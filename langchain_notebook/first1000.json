Fetal cardiac deformation changes can be the first sign of placental dysfunction, which is associated with HDP, FGR and preterm birth. In addition, preterm birth is likely associated with changes in electrical activity across the uterine muscle. Therefore, fetal cardiac function and uterine activity can be used for the early detection of these complications in pregnancy. Fetal cardiac function and uterine activity can be assessed by two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography (2D-STE), non-invasive fetal electrocardiography (NI-fECG), and electrohysterography (EHG). This study aims to generate reference values for 2D-STE, NI-fECG and EHG parameters during the second trimester of pregnancy and to investigate the diagnostic potential of these parameters in the early detection of HDP, FGR and preterm birth.METHODS: In this longitudinal prospective cohort study, eligible women will be recruited from a tertiary care hospital and a primary midwifery practice. In total, 594 initially healthy pregnant women with an uncomplicated singleton pregnancy will be included. Recordings of NI-fECG and EHG will be made weekly from 22 until 28 weeks of gestation and 2D-STE measurements will be performed 4-weekly at 16, 20, 24 and 28 weeks gestational age. Retrospectively, pregnancies complicated with pregnancy-related diseases will be excluded from the cohort. Reference values for 2D-STE, NI-fECG and EHG parameters will be assessed in uncomplicated pregnancies. After, 2D-STE, NI-fCG and EHG parameters measured during gestation in complicated pregnancies will be compared with these reference values.DISCUSSION: This will be the a large prospective study investigating new technologies that could potentially have a high impact on antepartum fetal monitoring.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Registered on 26 March 2020 in the Dutch Trial Register (NL8769) via https://www.trialregister.nl/trials and registered on 21 October 2020 to the Central Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects (NL73607.015.20) via https://www.toetsingonline.nl/to/ccmo_search.nsf/Searchform?OpenForm .",

However, most conventional cell separation techniques are labor-intensive and low throughput, require large volumes of samples, need extensive cell manipulation, and have low purity. To address these challenges, we report the design and fabrication of a passive, label-free microfluidic device with a unique U-shaped cross-section to separate WBCs from whole blood using hydrodynamic forces that exist in a microchannel with curvilinear geometry. It is shown that the spiral microchannel with a U-shaped cross-section concentrates larger blood cells (e.g., WBCs) in the inner cross-section of the microchannel by moving smaller blood cells (e.g., RBCs and platelets) to the outer microchannel section and preventing them from returning to the inner microchannel section. Therefore, it overcomes the major limitation of a rectangular cross-section where secondary Dean vortices constantly enforce particles throughout the entire cross-section and decrease its isolation efficiency. Under optimal settings, we managed to isolate more than 95% of WBCs from whole blood under high-throughput (6 mL/min), high-purity (88%), and high-capacity (360 mL of sample in 1 h) conditions. High efficiency, fast processing time, and non-invasive WBC isolation from large blood samples without centrifugation, RBC lysis, cell biomarkers, and chemical pre-treatments make this method an ideal choice for downstream cell study platforms.",

Using the hybrid structure, a perovskite-based guided-wave surface plasmon resonance (GWSPR) biosensor is proposed with high angular sensitivity. First, it is found that the electric field at the sensing interface is improved by the CH3NH3PbBr3 perovskite thin film, thereby enhancing the sensitivity. The result demonstrates that the angular sensitivity of the Au-perovskite-based GWSPR biosensor is as high as 278.5�/RIU, which is 110.2% higher than that of a conventional Au-based surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor. Second, the selection of the coupling prism in the configuration of the GWSPR biosensor is also analyzed, and it indicates that a low refractive index (RI) prism can generate greater sensitivity. Therefore, the low-RI BK7 prism is served as the coupling prism for the proposed GWSPR biosensor. Finally, the proposed GWSPR sensing structure can not only be used for liquid sensing, but also for gas sensing, and it has also been demonstrated that the GWSPR gas sensor is 2.8 times more sensitive than the Au-based SPR gas sensor.",

With their high volatility, the direct detection of organochlorides in environmental samples is challenging. Here, a new organochloride detection mechanism using 1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene (DBN) is introduced to simplify a sensing method with higher detection sensitivity. Three types of organochloride compounds-trichloroethylene (TCE), dichloromethane (DCM), and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT)-were targeted to understand DCM conjugation chemistry by using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and liquid chromatography with a mass spectrometer (LC-MS). 13C-NMR spectra and LC-MS data indicated that DBN can be labeled on these organochloride compounds by chlorine-nitrogen interaction. Furthermore, to demonstrate the organochloride sensing capability, the labeling yield and limit of detection were determined by a colorimetric assay as well as micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). The interaction with DBN was most appreciable for TCE, among other organochlorides. TCE was detected at picomolar levels, which is two orders of magnitude lower than the maximum contaminant level set by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. MEKC, in conjunction with this DBN-labeling method, enables us to develop a field-deployable sensing platform for detecting toxic organochlorides with high sensitivity.",

This work uses Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy to show that the MIR complex refractive index of whole blood varies across a range of haematocrit. This indicates that the use of an evanescent measurement is not sufficient to optically exclude the cellular content of blood in the MIR, as previously assumed. Here, spectral refractive index data is presented in two ways. First, it is given as whole blood with varying haematocrit. Second, it is given as the percentage error that haematocrit introduces to plasma. The maximum error in the effective plasma refractive index due to the haematocrit of healthy adults was 0.25% for the real part n and 11% for the imaginary part k. This implies that calibration measurements of haematocrit can be used to account for errors introduced by the cellular content, enabling plasma spectra and analyte concentrations to be indirectly calculated from a whole blood sample. This methodological advance is of clinical importance as plasma concentration of analytes such as drugs can be determined using MIR without the preprocessing of whole blood.",

However, their classification is challenging due to the similarity in texture patterns of both types of mass. The existing methods for this problem have low sensitivity and specificity. Based on the hypothesis that diverse contextual information of a mass region forms a strong indicator for discriminating benign and malignant masses and the idea of the ensemble classifier, we introduce a computer-aided system for this problem. The system uses multiple regions of interest (ROIs) encompassing a mass region for modeling diverse contextual information, a single ResNet-50 model (or its density-specific modification) as a backbone for local decisions, and stacking with SVM as a base model to predict the final decision. A data augmentation technique is introduced for fine-tuning the backbone model. The system was thoroughly evaluated on the benchmark CBIS-DDSM dataset using its provided data split protocol, and it achieved a sensitivity of 98.48% and a specificity of 92.31%. Furthermore, it was found that the system gives higher performance if it is trained and tested using the data from a specific breast density BI-RADS class. The system does not need to fine-tune/train multiple CNN models; it introduces diverse contextual information by multiple ROIs. The comparison shows that the method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods for classifying mass regions into benign and malignant. It will help radiologists reduce their burden and enhance their sensitivity in the prediction of malignant masses.",

Although most women are tested at ANC, they remain at risk for HIV exposure and transmission to their infant when their partners are not tested. This study evaluates how an HIV-enhanced and Centering-based group ANC model-Group ANC+ that uses interactive learning to practice partner communication is associated with improvements in partner HIV testing during pregnancy.METHODS: A randomized pilot study conducted in Malawi and Tanzania found multiple positive outcomes for pregnant women (n�= 218) assigned to Group ANC+ versus individual ANC. This analysis adds previously unpublished results for two late pregnancy outcomes: communication with partner about three reproductive health topics (safer sex, HIV testing, and family planning) and partner HIV testing since the first antenatal care visit. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to assess the effect of type of ANC on partner communication and partner testing. We also conducted a mediation analysis to assess whether partner communication mediated the effect of type of care on partner HIV testing.RESULTS: Nearly 70% of women in Group ANC+ reported communicating about reproductive health with their partner, compared to 45% of women in individual ANC. After controlling for significant covariates, women in group ANC were twice as likely as those in individual ANC to report that their partner got an HIV test (OR 1.99; 95% CI: 1.08, 3.66). The positive effect of the Group ANC + model on partner HIV testing was fully mediated by increased partner communication.CONCLUSIONS: HIV prevention was included in group ANC health promotion without compromising services and coverage of standard ANC topics, demonstrating that local high-priority health promotion needs can be integrated into ANC using a Group ANC+. These findings provide evidence that greater partner communication can promote healthy reproductive behaviors, including HIV prevention. Additional research is needed to understand the processes by which group ANC allowed women to discuss sensitive topics with partners and how these communications led to partner HIV testing.",

Enteroviruses, including EV-D68, are typically detected in the United States during late summer through fall, with year-to-year fluctuations. Before 2014, EV-D68 was infrequently reported to CDC (1). However, numbers of EV-D68 detection have increased in recent years, with a biennial pattern observed during 2014-2018 in the United States, after the expansion of surveillance and wider availability of molecular testing. In 2014, a national outbreak of EV-D68 was detected (2). EV-D68 was also reported in 2016 via local (3) and passive national (4) surveillance. EV-D68 detections were limited in 2017, but substantial circulation was observed in 2018 (5). To assess recent levels of circulation, EV-D68 detections in respiratory specimens collected from patients aged <18 years* with ARI evaluated in emergency departments (EDs) or admitted to one of seven U.S. medical centers† within the New Vaccine Surveillance Network (NVSN) were summarized. This report provides a provisional description of EV-D68 detections during July-November in 2018, 2019 and 2020, and describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of these patients. In 2018, a total of 382 EV-D68 detections in respiratory specimens obtained from patients aged <18 years with ARI were reported by NVSN; the number decreased to six detections in 2019 and 30 in 2020. Among patients aged <18 years with EV-D68 in 2020, 22 (73%) were non-Hispanic Black (Black) persons. EV-D68 detections in 2020 were lower than anticipated based on the biennial circulation pattern observed since 2014. The circulation of EV-D68 in 2020 might have been limited by widespread COVID-19 mitigation measures; how these changes in behavior might influence the timing and levels of circulation in future years is unknown. Ongoing monitoring of EV-D68 detections is warranted for preparedness for EV-D68-associated ARI and AFM.",

This study aimed to investigate whether COVID-19 patients had characteristic ECG findings in the acute period.METHODS: A total of 124 patients were divided into two groups as those diagnosed with COVID-19 and controls. The ECGs of these patients were evaluated in terms of rate, rhythm, presence of ST changes, PR interval, QRS width, QTc and QT interval, and presence of right and left bundle branch blocks.RESULTS: On the ECG, the median heart rate of the COVID-19 patients was 104/min (IQR: 99-114), and there was a significant difference compared to the control group (P<0.001). The median PR interval was 157/ms, the QRS width was 86 � 9/ms in the COVID-19 patients, with no significant difference compared to the controls (P = 0.161 and P = 0.631, respectively). The median QT interval of the COVID-19 patients was normal (400/ms), but a significant difference was detected compared to the controls (P = 0.005). The QTc, ST change, AF, and presence of right and left bundle branch blocks were not significantly different between the two groups.CONCLUSION: Considering the importance of ECG findings in order to diagnose COVID-19 disease early, we can state that sinus tachycardia is very common in COVID-19 patients, but there is no characteristic ECG finding for COVID-19, including tachycardia.",

Mean � SD age of included mothers and mean � SD gestational age at admission were 30.6 � 6.2 years and 30.8 � 8.9 weeks, respectively. The common symptoms were fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea and myalgia. The mortality rates of pregnant women and neonates were 28 out of 151 (18.5%) and 4 out of 17 (23.5%), respectively. Most of the neonates were preterm at the time of delivery. Three neonates had positive RT-PCR test on the first day after birth and three others on day two. On the average, neonate's PCR became positive on day 4 for the first time.CONCLUSION: Early diagnosis of COVID-19 is crucial due to the possibility of the prenatal complications.

Importantly, several currently circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants are associated with loss of efficacy for both vaccines and neutralizing antibodies.METHODS: We analyzed the binding activity of six highly potent antibodies to the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2 variants, assessed their neutralizing abilities with pseudovirus and authentic SARS-CoV-2 variants and evaluate efficacy of antibody cocktail in Delta SARS-CoV-2-infected hamster models as prophylactic and post-infection treatments.RESULTS: The tested RBD-chAbs, except RBD-chAb-25, maintained binding ability to spike proteins from SARS-CoV-2 variants. However, only RBD-chAb-45 and -51 retained neutralizing activities; RBD-chAb-1, -15, -25 and -28 exhibited diminished neutralization for all SARS-CoV-2 variants. Notably, several cocktails of our antibodies showed low IC50 values (3.35-27.06�ng/ml) against the SARS-CoV-2 variant pseudoviruses including United Kingdom variant B.1.1.7 (Alpha), South Africa variant B.1.351 (Beta), Brazil variant P1 (Gamma), California variant B.1.429 (Epsilon), New York variant B.1.526 (Iota), and India variants, B.1.617.1 (Kappa) and B.1.617.2 (Delta). RBD-chAb-45, and -51 showed PRNT50 values 4.93-37.54�ng/ml when used as single treatments or in combination with RBD-chAb-15 or -28, according to plaque assays with authentic Alpha, Gamma and Delta SARS-CoV-2 variants. Furthermore, the antibody cocktail of RBD-chAb-15 and -45 exhibited potent prophylactic and therapeutic effects in Delta SARS-CoV-2 variant-infected hamsters.CONCLUSIONS: The cocktail of RBD-chAbs exhibited potent neutralizing activities against SARS-CoV-2 variants. These antibody cocktails are highly promising candidate tools for controlling new SARS-CoV-2 variants, including Delta.",

This study was conducted to examine the safety of the COVID-19 vaccine for people who were ? 75 years of age, specifically those who first took two doses of the vaccine at the COVID-19 central vaccination center in South Korea.METHODS: Safety monitoring after the BNT162b2 vaccine was conducted in three ways for older adults who received the first dose of the vaccine at our center between April 5 and April 23, 2021. For immediate adverse reactions, every person who was vaccinated was observed for 15-30 minutes after injection at the center. For active surveillance, a telephone interview was conducted for stratified randomly sampled people after 7 days of each vaccination to enquire regarding types of adverse reactions they experienced, and its severity and duration. For passive surveillance, reported adverse event data were collected from the COVID-19 vaccine adverse event following immunization (AEFI) surveillance system-run by the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA). The data were then reviewed.RESULTS: In total, 2,123 older adults received at least one vaccine dose during the study period. The frequency of acute adverse reactions that developed during the observed 15-30 minutes after injection was 8.5 cases per 1,000 doses. None of the reactions was assessed as acute allergic reactions to the vaccine and no cases required special treatment or drug administration. Overall, 638 people were followed up at least once by telephone interview 7 days post vaccination. The overall response rate was 82.3%. The rates of local reactions were 50.3% after the first dose and 45.2% after the second dose, and the rates of systemic reactions were 15.2% and 26.0%, respectively. During the study period, 23 medically attended adverse events (5.4 cases per 1,000 administered doses) were reported to the KDCA AEFI surveillance system. The most common symptoms of medically attended cases were nonspecific general weakness (26%) and dizziness (26%), followed by muscle pain (22%), headache (13%), fever (13%), and skin rash or urticaria (13%). Among them, there were five serious adverse events reported, which required hospitalization, including one death. However, most of them were not related to the vaccines.CONCLUSION: BNT162b2 vaccination was tolerable among adults who were ? 75 years of age.",

Specifically, students were divided evenly throughout three surgical departments, each of which followed a different clinical schedule.RESULTS: National Board of Medical Examiners clerkship scores of third-year medical students who were returning to in-person clinical clerkships after transitioning from 8 weeks of online-based learning showed no significant difference from the previous 2 years.CONCLUSIONS: To manage with the restrictions caused by COVID-19 pandemic, we designed an alternative approach to a traditional surgical clerkship that minimized the risk of exposure and used online learning tools to navigate scheduling challenges. This curriculum enabled students to complete their clinical rotation objectives and outcomes while maintaining program standards. Furthermore, this approach provided a number of benefits, which medical schools should consider adopting the model into practice even in a post-pandemic setting.",

The satisfaction of basic psychological needs and motivation as described by the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) yield associations with outcomes such as quality of life and job satisfaction. The current study is the first study to examine whether motivation and basic psychological needs are predictive for RTW outcomes at 1-year follow-up.METHODS: About 349 people with a work disability (mean�=�131.32�days off work) participated in this observational longitudinal research. Quality of motivation (MAWS) and basic psychological need satisfaction and frustration (BPNSFS) were measured at baseline. At 12-month follow-up, differences in RTW were assessed in terms of (1) time until RTW, (2) partial RTW, (3) relapse within 12�months, (4) work disability longer than 12�months. Binary logistic and cox regression analyses were used.RESULTS: Controlled motivation regarding the former job was related to shorter time until RTW. Autonomous motivation and amotivation did not seem predictive for RTW variables. The frustration of the basic needs was related to a longer work disability, need satisfaction was not related to the RTW variables. No significant predictors for relapse and partial RTW were found.CONCLUSIONS: The frustration of basic psychological needs was predictive for a longer work disability. Controlled motivation on the other hand predicted faster RTW, which was an unexpected direction. SDT seems to have predictive value, yet underlying mechanisms remain unclear.",

We aimed to describe the epidemiology of COVID-19 in universities/colleges in Seoul Metropolitan Area during COVID-19 pandemic period.METHODS: Among the 38 universities in Seoul, 23 have agreed to participate in the study. Confirmed COVID-19 cases were identified from individual-level case reports submitted to the universities and to the health authorities from February 1, 2020, to June 30, 2021. Through the linkage with the Central Disease Control Headquarters' database, number of secondary infected cases (both within and outside of the campus) were counted.RESULTS: Between February 2020 and June 2021, a total of 827 COVID-19 cases were confirmed and reported in the universities across Seoul Metropolitan City. Generally, the community-associated cases had peaks preceding the university/college-associated. Of those with the documented clinical parameters, 38.6% of the cases were asymptomatic. Among them, 93% were potentially exposed off-campus, and 87.7% of the cases had not produced the secondary infection cases.CONCLUSION: In the setting of rigorous infection prevention measures in combination with on- and off- hybrid classes, COVID-19 incidences and outbreaks were limited in university and college campus area across Seoul Metropolitan Area. The evidence around the infection preventive measures in higher education facilities in Seoul Metropolitan Area, suggest insignificant impact on community transmission.",

She insisted that the foreign body was the fragment of stent and asked for medical malpractice indemnity payments while the surgeon of her insisted that the stent was intact during the procedure. Finally, the foreign body was confirmed as an encrustation by cystoscopy and the patient received 10,000 yuan ($ 1500) as indemnity payments after encrustation removal.CONCLUSION: In the absence of guidelines, stent indwelling time vary with centers' habits, stent materials and patient's education. Early detection of stent encrustation and timely removal of the encrusted stent are still the best way to avoid stent retention. Violent stent removal is of danger and not recommended in any case.",

Its pathogenesis remains unclear, and there is the added challenge of selecting an appropriate delivery time to achieve excellent neonatal outcomes.METHODS: Our Hospital is a critical maternal rescue center with approximately 7000 births annually. We present a series of 8 cases of umbilical artery thrombosis diagnosed at the hospital between Apr 1, 2018, and Jan 31, 2020. We identified the cases through a keyword search of the maternity and pathology information management systems.RESULTS: Three patients were diagnosed with a transabdominal ultrasound scan and hypoxia on fetal heart monitoring. All three patients had emergency cesarean section delivery. Four patients were observed closely for 5 to 13 weeks from initial detection by an ultrasound scan to delivery. Only one patient was diagnosed after vaginal delivery by Hematoxylin-eosin staining of umbilical cord sections. Seven patients had deliveries by cesarean section, and one patient had a vaginal delivery. All infants were born alive.CONCLUSIONS: Umbilical artery thrombosis is a challenging and rare condition that can occur at different gestational ages, especially when diagnosed in the third trimester and accompanied by fetal growth restriction. Consequently, these patients require close monitoring of umbilical blood flow and fetal growth and intervention at the appropriate time to achieve an optimal outcome.",

Describe the characteristics of arginine.2. Choose the metabolic processes that define arginine's role in wound healing.3. Identify the average daily intake of arginine in an American diet.4. Select the evidence that demonstrates the effectiveness of arginine supplementation for wound healing.ABSTRACT: Nutrition has an important and integral role in wound healing. Arginine, a type of indispensable amino acid, has long been thought to have wound healing properties. The 2019 international guideline by the European Pressure Ulcer Advisory Panel, National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel, and Pan Pacific Pressure Injury Alliance recommends use of a high-protein, high-calorie oral nutrition supplement fortified with arginine and other antioxidants to treat adults with stage 2 or greater pressure injury and who are malnourished or at risk of malnutrition to foster healing. This article provides necessary background on this conditionally indispensable amino acid, its metabolism, and its role in acute and chronic wound healing to assist providers in understanding the recommendation for arginine supplementation.",

The Self-rating Anxiety Scale and Self-rating Depression Scale were used to measure anxiety and depression. Patients' coping style and their social support were assessed through face-to-face interviews.RESULTS: Overall, 36.6% of participants presented with symptoms of anxiety, and 37% showed depressive symptoms. Participants who typically had less than 5 hours of sleep; experienced more severe pain; or had an odorous wound, negative coping style, or lower level of social support had a higher prevalence of anxiety and depression (P < .05). Men with higher monthly incomes who lived in the city were more likely to develop anxiety than women with lower monthly incomes who lived outside the city (P < .05). Participants with fewer years of education and without spouses were more likely to experience depression than married participants with more education (P < .05).CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of anxiety and depression among hospitalized patients with a chronic wound is high.

Face-to-face, audio-recorded, semistructured interviews were used to collect data regarding patient experience with either a transparent or opaque ostomy pouch. Data were collected between August and November 2019. Audio tapes were transcribed verbatim and analyzed using a thematic analysis technique focused on describing patient lived experience.RESULTS: Five themes were discovered: \"undercover,\" \"fiscal consideration,\" \"past medical experience,\" \"self-esteem,\" and \"functionality.\" Most participants focused on appliance functionality over pouch opacity in the immediate postoperative period. However, participants did describe difficulties adjusting to their new stoma and noted that an opaque pouch can improve postoperative comfort. Past exposure to medical devices, particularly in terms of their cost, may impact the decision to use a transparent or opaque pouching system.CONCLUSIONS: Pouching systems that are opaque while still allowing for assessment of the pouching contents and stoma are ideal. When this is not available, providers should consider the patient's wishes to alleviate any psychosocial effects the opacity of the pouching system may have.",

Preoperative MRI scan was conducted on all patients. The volume estimation and three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction were performed based on MRI data using a 3D Slicer. Based on the resulting volume, a muscle flap that could fit the dead space was selected. Surgery was performed with the selected muscle flap, and a fasciocutaneous flap was added, if necessary.RESULTS: A total of eight patients with ischial pressure injuries were included in the study. The mean patient age was 59.0 � 11.0 years. The mean body mass index was 26.62 � 3.89 kg/m2. The mean volume of dead space was 104.75 � 81.05 cm3. The gracilis muscle was the most selected muscle flap and was used in four patients. In five of eight cases, a fasciocutaneous flap was used as well. The mean follow-up period was 16 months, and by that point, none of the patients evinced complications that required surgery.CONCLUSIONS: To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report on volumetric evaluation of dead space in ischial pressure injuries. The authors believe that the 3D reconstruction process would enable adequate dead space obliteration in ischial pressure injuries. The authors propose that preoperative MRI scans in patients with ischial pressure injury should become an essential part of the process.",

This study sought a greater understanding of these risk factors to stratify patients based on risk and guide clinical decision-making.METHODS: Investigators analyzed the data of 864 consecutive patients referred to the RT center of the Southern Theater General Hospital for a new RSL from 2013 to 2019. These patients were followed up for an average of approximately 16 months until their death or March 30, 2020, whichever came first. Multivariate logistic regression analysis and Cox proportional hazards model were used to identify predictors of grade 3 or 4 dermatitis.RESULTS: The main causes of treatment interruption included dermatitis and oral mucositis. Significant patient-specific risk factors for RSLs included current smoking, current drinking, and lower Karnofsky Performance Scale score and significant procedure-specific risk factors included receiving intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), hyperfractionated RT, induction chemotherapy, multicycle chemotherapy, and taxol- and cisplatin-based drugs. The three factors that independently predicted risk of RSL were IMRT, lower Karnofsky Performance Scale score, and multicycle chemotherapy. Comparing predictive factors among patients with severe RSL revealed that patients who received IMRT were more likely to develop grade 3 or 4 dermatitis.CONCLUSIONS: Oncology providers should note that IMRT is an aggressive technique with a trend toward increased RSL. Providers should pay special attention to adverse effects to skin in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",

The objectives of this study were to estimate the frequency of metabolic abnormalities in the urine of patients with urolithiasis and to determine their possible link with the chemical composition of stones.Methods: we conducted a cross-sectional study evaluating 73 patients referred for urolithiasis in 8 clinics in Kinshasa, between January 2017 and September 2019. Twenty four-hour or early morning urine were collected and analyzed in the Tenon Hospital in Paris. Parameters analyzed included pH, specific gravity, creatinine, uric acid, calcium, phosphate, oxalate, citrate and magnesium. Chi square test or chi-square likelihood-ratio and student's t test were used as statistical tests.Results: overall, 89% (n=65) of patients with lithiasis had metabolic abnormalities. Mean (SD) age of patients was 47.0 (14.2) years with male to female ratio of 1.6: 1. The mean (SD) 24-hour diuresis was 1836.4 (1216.9) ml; the mean (SD) urine density was 1.018 (0.007); and the mean (SD) pH was 6.1(0.8). Hypocitraturia was the most frequently observed metabolic abnormality and was found in 76.7% patients. Other significant metabolic abnormalities were low magnesuria (35.6%), hyperoxaluria (11%), and low sulphaturia (74%). Whewellite (73.5%) was the main chemical component. The mean pH was higher in patients with carbapatite and struvite stones (p=0.031).Conclusion: this study suggests that inadequate diuresis and hypocitraturia were important lithogenic factors. The population should be encouraged to increase water intake to limit the frequency of urine super saturation with crystals.",

We explored the psychological impacts of COVID-19 among people living with diabetes mellitus in Ghana.Methods: this study employed a hospital-based cross-sectional design involving 157 diabetes mellitus patients aged 20 years and above. We assessed diabetes distress by the seventeen-item diabetes stress (DDS17) scale and COVID-19 worries by 3 specific benchmarks: \"worry about overly affected due to diabetes if infected with COVID-19\", \"worry about people with diabetes characterized as a risk group\" and \"worry about not able to manage diabetes if infected with COVID-19\". A close-ended questionnaire was used in data collection.Results: of 157 diabetic patients interviewed, the majority had type 2 diabetes mellitus with known complications and only 42.7% were managing COVID-19 symptoms. The participants showed moderate to high level of COVID-19 specific worry, moderate fear of isolation, and low level of diabetes-associated distress. About 33.8% of the study population expressed a sense of worry towards the pandemic. The logistic regression showed that age, employment status, and presence of other chronic diseases were significantly associated with worries about being overly affected if infected with COVID-19 due to their diabetes status. Age and sex were associated with worries about people with diabetes being characterized as a risk group and age, sex and employment status were associated with participants who were worried about not being able to manage diabetes if infected with COVID-19.Conclusion: the general trend indicates a sense of worry among diabetes patients during the COVID-19 pandemic which is associated with poorer psychological health.

Aim: this study aimed to determine the perceptions and practices of mothers with regards to the establishment of dental home at four local government areas (LGAs) in Lagos, Nigeria.Methods: was a community-based descriptive household survey conducted amongst mothers in Alimosho, Ikorodu, Surulere and Epe LGAs of Lagos State. Socio-demographic data, information about the importance of primary teeth, knowledge about dental home as well as their child?s age at first dental visit and reasons for attending was obtained with a validated, structured interviewer administered questionnaire. Descriptive statistics, Chi-square and multivariable regression analysis were conducted, and the level of significance was set at P<0.05.Results: the highest proportion of the mothers were aged between 26-30 years (27.4%; mean age: 34.58�7.8 years) and had a tertiary level of education (n=206, 59.9%); most respondents (n=80, 51.4%) did not know the age a child should be taken to the dental clinic for the first time and had not taken their child for any dental visit (n=229, 65.4%). Out of those who had previously taken their child for dental visits, the greater proportion (n=115, 95.0%) took the child when he/she was older than one year of age. Overall, only 126 (36.0%) respondents had a good perception about oral health and the need for a dental home while 224 (64.0%) respondents had poor knowledge. Logistic regression analysis of predictor variables that showed mothers with a tertiary level of education (OR=0.108; CI=0.0023-0.495) and those with 2-3 children (OR=0.482; CI=0.253-0.920) had significant lower odds of poor perception about the importance of a dental home.Conclusion: maternal knowledge and practices with regards to dental home were poor and inadequate. It is necessary to create more awareness among parents/caregivers, especially through antenatal and immunization clinics to establish the concept of dental home.",

The present study aimed to investigate the associated influence of COVID-19 on renal function in patients admitted to the intensive care unit in Asir region, Saudi Arabia. Thirty patients infected with COVID-19 who were referred to the intensive care unit during November and October 2020 at Asir central hospital, Asir region, Saudi Arabia were recruited. The age of patients ranged between 30 and 90 years old. Renal function tests exhibited dramatic changes in the renal biomarkers in patients with COVID-19. Blood urea levels in COVID-19 patients were significantly higher than in the control group. In addition, significantly lower albumin levels with abnormally decreased total protein levels were found in COVID-19 patients. Among the different electrolytes analyzed, a significantly lower calcium level was observed in COVID-19 patients' groups than in the controls. Renal function tests for COVID-19-infected ICU patients revealed significant changes, indicating the major impact of COVID-19 on kidney function. Monitoring renal function tests may assist in the early prognosis of COVID-19 patients. It is, therefore, crucial to increase the understanding of renal function tests in COVID-19 patients who were admitted to the hospital before their condition deteriorated.",

In particular, the high ratio of COVID-19 pandemic in Pakistan is significantly deteriorating human mental as well as physical health. The huge mental and physical loss has taught several lessons, which have been retrieved from already existing literature. The latest researches were consulted to identify the challenges and solution to combat COVID-19. First of all, the pharmacy communities in Pakistan are not sufficient to handle the burden of COVID-19 due to economic issues. However, the Government should provide interest-free loans to students and researchers for conducting scholarly work for manufacturing advance medication to combat against COVID-19. Secondly, the drugs that have been used to control the spread of COVID-19, found to be associated with the development of a neuropsychiatric complication. Therefore, there is a dire need to develop more mental health services to control the medication side effects. Thirdly as the traditional mental health services are not sufficient to provide effective and advanced mental health services, therefore, transformative changes through community psychology are mandatory to implement. Lastly, as communicable disease limit the geographical access to avail mental health services. Therefore, the e-CBT approaches must be provided to mitigate the pre and post-pandemic effects. The findings of the study would provide the direction for preparing to combat communicable diseases in the future.",

We performed genome-wide association analyses of antibody levels against these 14 infections (N = 357 - 5010) and identified three genome-wide signals (P < 5?10-8), two associated with measles virus antibodies and one with Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. In an association analysis focused on the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region of the genome, we further detected 15 HLA alleles at a two-digit resolution and 23 HLA alleles at a four-digit resolution associated with five antibodies, with eight HLA alleles associated with Epstein-Barr virus antibodies showing strong evidence of replication in UK Biobank.

However, the pathogenesis of myocardial injury in COVID-19 remains unclear, and cardiac involvement by SARS-CoV-2 presents a major challenge worldwide.Objective: This histological and immunohistochemical study sought to clarify the pathogenesis and propose a mechanism with pathways involved in COVID-19 myocardial injury.Methods and Results: Postmortem minimally invasive autopsies were performed in six patients who died from COVID-19, and the myocardium samples were compared to a control group (n=11). Histological analysis was performed using hematoxylin-eosin and toluidine blue staining. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was performed using monoclonal antibodies against targets: caspase-1, caspase-9, gasdermin-d, ICAM-1, IL-1�, IL-4, IL-6, CD163, TNF-�, TGF-�, MMP-9, type 1 and type 3 collagen. The samples were also assessed for apoptotic cells by TUNEL. Histological analysis showed severe pericardiocyte interstitial edema and higher mast cells counts per high-power field in all COVID-19 myocardium samples. The IHC analysis showed increased expression of caspase-1, ICAM-1, IL-1�, IL-6, MMP-9, TNF-�, and other markers in the hearts of COVID-19 patients. Expression of caspase-9 did not differ from the controls, while gasdermin-d expression was less. The TUNEL assay was positive in all the COVID-19 samples supporting endothelial apoptosis.Conclusions: The pathogenesis of COVID-19 myocardial injury does not seem to relate to primary myocardiocyte involvement but to local inflammation with associated interstitial edema. We found heightened TGF-� and interstitial collagen expression in COVID-affected hearts, a potential harbinger of chronic myocardial fibrosis. These results suggest a need for continued clinical surveillance of patients for myocardial dysfunction and arrythmias after recovery from the acute phase of COVID-19.",

The genome of SARS-CoV-2 encodes four major structural proteins - the spike (S) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, membrane (M) protein, and the envelope (E) protein. However, the role of these proteins in either binding to or activation of the complement system and/or the KKS is still incompletely understood. In these studies, we used: solid phase ELISA, hemolytic assay and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques to examine if recombinant proteins corresponding to S1, N, M and E: (a) bind to C1q, gC1qR, FXII and high molecular weight kininogen (HK), and (b) activate complement and/or the KKS. Our data show that the viral proteins: (a) bind C1q and activate the classical pathway of complement, (b) bind FXII and HK, and activate the KKS in normal human plasma to generate bradykinin and (c) bind to gC1qR, the receptor for the globular heads of C1q (gC1q) which in turn could serve as a platform for the activation of both the complement system and KKS. Collectively, our data indicate that the SARS-CoV-2 viral particle can independently activate major innate inflammatory pathways for maximal damage and efficiency. Therefore, if efficient therapeutic modalities for the treatment of COVID-19 are to be designed, a strategy that includes blockade of the four major structural proteins may provide the best option.",

Protective antibody-mediated viral neutralization in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection has been firmly characterized. Where the effects of the antibody response are generally considered to be beneficial, an important biological question regarding potential negative outcomes of a SARS-CoV-2 antibody response has yet to be answered. We determined the distribution of IgG subclasses and complement activation levels in plasma from convalescent individuals using in-house developed ELISAs. The IgG response towards SARS-CoV-2 receptor-binding domain (RBD) after natural infection appeared to be mainly driven by IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses, which are the main ligands for C1q mediated classical complement pathway activation. The deposition of the complement components C4b, C3bc, and TCC as a consequence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies were depending primarily on the SARS-CoV-2 RBD and significantly correlated with both IgG levels and disease severity, indicating that individuals with high levels of IgG and/or severe disease, might have a more prominent complement activation during viral infection. Finally, freshly isolated monocytes and a monocyte cell line (THP-1) were used to address the cellular mediated inflammatory response as a consequence of Fc-gamma receptor engagement by SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. Monocytic Fc gamma receptor charging resulted in a significant rise in the secretion of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-�. Our results indicate that SARS-CoV-2 antibodies might drive significant inflammatory responses through the classical complement pathway and via cellular immune-complex activation that could have negative consequences during COVID-19 disease. We found that increased classical complement activation was highly associated to COVID-19 disease severity. The combination of antibody-mediated complement activation and subsequent cellular priming could constitute a significant risk of exacerbating COVID-19 severity.",

This cohort accurately reflects the characteristics of the first wave of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in Italy. We determined the IgM, IgA, and IgG levels towards SARS-CoV-2 S1, S2, and NP antigens, evaluating their neutralizing activity and relationship with clinical signatures. Moreover, we longitudinally followed 72 patients up to 9 months postsymptoms onset to study the persistence of the levels of antibodies. Our results showed that the majority of COVID-19 patients developed an early virus-specific antibody response. The magnitude and the neutralizing properties of the response were heterogeneous regardless of the severity of the disease. Antibody levels dropped over time, even though spike reactive IgG and IgA were still detectable up to 9 months. Early baseline antibody levels were key drivers of the subsequent antibody production and the long-lasting protection against SARS-CoV-2. Importantly, we identified anti-S1 IgA as a good surrogate marker to predict the clinical course of COVID-19. Characterizing the antibody response after SARS-CoV-2 infection is relevant for the early clinical management of patients as soon as they are diagnosed and for implementing the current vaccination strategies.",

Symptoms in mother and infant were assessed by detailed questionnaires. Anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody levels in blood and milk were measured by Pylon 3D automated immunoassay and ELISA. In addition, vaccine-related PEGylated proteins in milk were measured by ELISA. Blood samples were collected from a subset of infants whose mothers received the vaccine during lactation (4-15 weeks after mothers' 2nd dose).Results: No severe maternal or infant adverse events were reported in this cohort. Two mothers and two infants were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the study period before achieving full immune response. PEGylated proteins were not found at significant levels in milk after vaccination. After vaccination, levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM significantly increased in maternal plasma and there was significant transfer of anti-SARS-CoV-2-Receptor Binding Domain (anti-RBD) IgA and IgG antibodies to milk. Milk IgA levels after the 2nd dose were negatively associated with infant age.

We aimed to describe the national burden of non-communicable diseases in 2017 and to analyze disability-adjusted life year trends from 1990 to 2017 in Tunisia by cause and gender.Methods: we used Joinpoint regression analysis to assess trends of the age standardized disability-adjusted life year rate from 1990 to 2017 and to determine average annual percentage change.Results: non-communicable diseases accounted for 87.7% of total disability-adjusted life year in Tunisia in 2017. The five leading causes of this rate in Tunisia in 2017 were cardiovascular diseases, musculoskeletal disorders, neoplasms, mental disorders and neurological disorders. The trend of disability-adjusted life year rate of non-communicable diseases decreased significantly from 23403.2 per 100.000 (95% CI: 20830.2-26285.8) in 1990 to 18454.6 (95% CI: 15611.3-21555.4) in 2017, with a change of -0.9%; p=0.00. The decrease of the age standardized disability-adjusted life year rate concerned mainly cardiovascular diseases and neoplasms secondly. This decrease was more important in female (change=-1.1, p=0.00) in comparison to males (change=-0.7, p=0.00). On the other hand, the increase of the standardized disability-adjusted life year rate was related to musculoskeletal disorders, diabetes, kidney disorders and substance use disorders with a significant annual percentage change of 0.1%, 0.2% and 1.3% (p=0.00) respectively.

Majority (81.5%) of the respondents were sexually active and 64.1% had fertility desire. On awareness of MTCT 62.5% had heard of MTCT but only 28.2% had good knowledge. No association was found between knowledge of MTCT and sexuality and fertility desire respectively.Conclusion: PLHIV had high awareness but poor knowledge on MTCT of HIV, hence the need for healthcare workers to provide sexual and reproductive health counselling including information on MTCT to both male and female PLHIV during routine clinic visits.",

Early detection of such factors will improve its prevention, management and outcome. This study aimed to evaluate the incidence, socio-demographic characteristics and pre-hospital care of children presenting with circulatory failure (shock) in children?s emergency room (CHER).Methods: this study adopted cross-sectional design in CHER of the University of Benin Teaching Hospital, Nigeria, from October 2018 to March 2019. Data were collected using a semi-structured questionnaire eliciting demography, socio-economic status, pre-hospital care and presence of shock. In a sub-analysis, multiple logistic regression identified variables that are independently associated with circulatory failure in the participants, using adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).Results: a total of 554 acutely-ill children participated in the study. Their median age was 60 (IQR: 24-132) months. Shock was present in 79 (14.3%) of the children on arrival at CHER. Children referred from private clinics were more likely to arrive CHER in shock compared to those coming directly from home (OR = 2.67, 95%CI: 1.07-6.69; p = 0.036) while children from lower socio-economic class families presented more frequently with shock than those from higher class (OR = 14.39, 95% CI: 2.61-79.44; p = 0.002). Also, children that received oral rehydration solution as pre-hospital care seemed more likely to present with shock in CHER (OR = 6.63, 95% CI: 2.15-20.46; p =0.001).Conclusion: quality of pre-hospital care and parental socio-economic status influence the presence of shock in children seen at the emergency unit. Focused health education and prevention of finance-related delays in emergency care are needed.",

Initial electrocardiogram (ECG) showed a long QT interval (QTc = 600 milliseconds). Laboratory tests revealed elevated troponin and lack of evidence of viral infection. Further investigations revealed the vaccine-induced myocarditis and arrhythmias linked to it. Within one week of magnesium treatment, the QT interval was completely corrected, and the patient discharged with no typical syncope attacks. This case like the previous reported one confirms that myocarditis is a complication of COVID-19 vaccine, but implies its clinical manifestations may be varied and even may happen after the single dose of vaccination.",

Minimally invasive aortic valve replacement (MIAVR) has been recently adopted as a new approach. According to the literature, the superiority of MIAVR is controversial. In this study we report early post-operative outcomes in MIAVR compared with MFS access with reference to blood Loss, wound infections, post-operative recovery, morbidity and mortality.Methods: this study was a prospective data collection from 36 consecutive patients undergoing isolated valve replacement. Two population study was identified, MIAVR group (group I n=18) and MFS group (group II n=18). Patients? data were collected and analyzed using IBM SPSS statistics 21 software and Khi2 test has been used to compare the variables. The study variables are presented as numbers, percentage, median with interquartile range. Pre-operative planning was performed so that to obtain similar characteristics.Results: in group I, upper mini-sternotomy was used in 12 patients and right mini-thoracotomy in 6 patients. There was no difference in term of mortality and morbidity. MIAVR was associated with longer CPB time (93.25 (58-161) vs 131 (75-215) mins, P=0.047) with no significant difference in term of ACC time (81 (33-162) vs 58.8 (59-102) mins P=0.158). MIAVR? Patients had likely lower incidence of red blood cells transfusion (16.7 vs 52.3%) without significant difference about post-operative haemoglobin (P = 0,330). Patients in group I had shorter ventilation time (2.35 (1-12) vs 9.3 (1-48) hours P < 0.01), shorter ICU stay (2.44 (1-8) vs 4.25 (1-9) days, P = 0,024). The length of hospital stay was shorter, 6.5 (5-9) days in group I vs 7.4 (6-11), P=0.0274. Length of chest tube stay was shorter in group I (mean 1.53 vs 2.4 days, P=0,033). Wound infections were not found in both groups.Conclusion: minimally invasive aortic valve replacement is associated with less blood loss, faster post-operative recovery faster post-operative recovery but increase operation time.",

The study aimed to determine the prevalence of depression and associated factors among medical students in a university in Nigeria.Methods: a cross-sectional study design was used. All matriculated medical students of Ebonyi State University Abakaliki, Nigeria were included in the study. Information was obtained using a self-administered structured questionnaire. Beck?s depression inventory was used to determine the prevalence of depression. Chi square test was used to ascertain association between variables. Level of statistical significance was determined by p value of <0.05.Results: the mean age of the students was 23.2 � 3.3 years and majority, 60.2% were males. Prevalence of depression was 17.4%. Third-year class (major examination class) had the highest proportion of students who were depressed, 24.2% while final year class had the least, 8.8%. Coping mechanisms for low moods included sleeping, 50.4% and having interactions with colleagues, 46.9%. Factors associated with depression included being <25 years, (p=0.008), being in the pre-clinical school, (p=0.023) and being afraid some students may not graduate from medical school (p=0.030).Conclusion: burden of depression was high among the students and most pronounced among third year students. There is need for proper orientation of newly admitted medical students on the medical curriculum by authorities of the university. Efforts should be made to decrease undue anxiety among students especially during examination. Adequate measures should be put in place for early detection and prompt management of cases of depression among the students.",

Since TFH cells primarily reside in lymphoid tissues, they can be challenging to study in human settings. However, a counterpart of these cells, circulating TFH (cTFH) cells, can be detected in peripheral blood. Assessment of cTFH cells serves as an informative marker of humoral responses following viral infection and vaccination and can be predictive of antibody titers. Here, we describe a comprehensive flow cytometry detection method for dissecting cTFH subsets and activation, together with the assessment of antibody-secreting cells (ASCs), from a small volume of human whole blood. This approach allows the investigation of cellular events that underpin successful immune responses following influenza and SARS-CoV-2 infection/vaccination in humans and is applicable to other viral disease settings.",

Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore whether XPC polymorphisms were relevant to the genetic susceptibility to PE in Chinese Han women.METHOD: A total of 1276 healthy pregnant women were included as the control group and 958 pregnant women with PE as the case group. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood samples to perform genotyping of loci rs2228001 and rs2228000 in XPC through real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The relationship between XPC and susceptibility to PE was evaluated by comparing the genotypic and allelic frequencies between the two groups of pregnant women.RESULTS: Polymorphism of rs2228000 may be associated with PE risk and allele T may play a protective role (genotype, �2 = 38.961, P�< 0.001 and allele �2 = 21.746 P�< 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 0.885, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.840-0.932).

When the frequencies of genotypes and alleles for early- and late-onset PE, mild PE and severe PE were compared with those of controls, the results were consistent with the large clinical sample.CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that the genetic variant rs2228000 in XPC may be associated with PE risk in Chinese Han women, and that pregnant women with the TT genotype have a reduced risk of PE. Further investigations are needed to confirm these findings in other regions or larger prospective populations.",

Traditional interventions such as psychotherapy and antidepressant medications are often not feasible or desirable. The purpose of this study was to examine two low cost, brief, accessible interventions designed to prevent postpartum depression and perceived stress among women at high risk.METHODS: Participants (n = 450) who were on average four weeks postpartum, had a history of depression before pregnancy, and exercised less than 60 min per week were randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions: (1) 6-month telephone-based exercise intervention; (2) 6-month telephone-based wellness/support intervention (e.g., healthy eating, sleep, and perceived stress); or (3) usual care.RESULTS: Overall, 2.4% of participants met criteria for depression at 6 months and 3.6% at 9 months with no differences between groups. At 6 months following randomization, median symptoms of depression were significantly lower among wellness participants compared to usual care participants (b = - 1.00, SE = 0.46, p = .03). Perceived stress at 6 months post-randomization was significantly lower among exercise vs. usual care participants (b = - 2.00, SE = .98, p = .04) and exercise vs. wellness participants (b = - 2.20, SE = 1.11, p = .04).CONCLUSIONS: The wellness intervention was efficacious for preventing symptoms of depression; however, postpartum depression that met the diagnostic criteria was surprisingly low in all conditions among this at risk sample of postpartum women. Exercise interventions may have a protective effect on perceived stress among women at risk for postpartum depression. Practitioners should consider integrating exercise and wellness interventions into postpartum care.TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinical Trials Number: NCT01883479 (06/21/2013).",

The global monitoring of country-level psychotropic medicine consumption trends can provide information on the extent of the availability of psychotropic medicines. The primary objective of this study was to investigate global trends in psychotropic medicines consumption from 2008 to 2019 across 65 countries and regions according to country income level and geographical region.METHODS: In this longitudinal trends study, we used pharmaceutical sales data from the IQVIA-Multinational Integrated Data Analysis System (IQVIA-MIDAS). We analysed monthly sales data of psychotropic medicines between Jan 1, 2008, and Dec 31, 2019. Total psychotropic medicine consumption included sales of antidepressants, antipsychotics, tranquilisers, sedatives or hypnotics, and mood stabilisers. Population estimates of each country or region (eight lower-middle-income countries, 19 upper-middle-income countries, and 38 high-income countries) were based on the UN World Population Prospects 2019 report. Average annual sales trends of psychotropic medicines, expressed as defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day, were estimated using a random-effects model adjusted for income level and region. Relative changes in the annual consumption of psychotropic medicines by income, expressed as DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, were assessed as percentage change for each medicine class.FINDINGS: Psychotropic medicine sales increased from 28�54 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in 2008 to 34�77 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day in 2019, corresponding to a 4�08% (95% CI 2�96-5�21) relative average increase annually. The absolute annual increase was greater in high-income countries (3�31 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, 95% CI 3�01-3�61) compared with upper-middle-income countries (1�94 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, 1�45-2�44) and low-middle-income countries (0�88 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day, 0�62-1�13; p<0�0001). The relative average annual increase in psychotropic medicine sales from 2008 to 2019 was greater in upper-middle-income countries (7�88%, 95% CI 6�99-8�77) than in lower-middle-income countries (2�90%, 2�40-3�39) and high-income countries (1�02%, 0�80-1�24). In 2019, the regional consumption of psychotropic medicines varied greatly, with the highest sales of all psychotropic medicine classes reported in northern America (167�54 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day) and lowest sales reported in Asia (5�59 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day). 17 countries had very low consumption of psychotropic medicines in 2019, including high-income countries and countries with a high prevalence of mental disorders.INTERPRETATION: The consumption of psychotropic medicines has increased over a 12-year period, and although the absolute growth rate was highest in high-income countries, the relative growth is highest in middle-income countries and especially upper-middle-income countries. Disparities in psychotropic medicine consumption of countries can only partly be explained by geographical location and income. Greater efforts are needed to increase the availability of psychotropic medicines in countries with very low consumption, which is probably due to financial or cultural reasons as well as scarcity of trained health-care professionals to prescribe psychotropic medicines.FUNDING: None.",

All women who gave birth in the period 2014 to 2018 were included. A series of multiple non-clinical interventions including a dedicated team of obstetricians for delivery room and antenatal counseling, monthly internal audits and physician education by local opinion leader were prospectively introduced from September 2016. The primary outcome of the study was the CS rate. The incidences of operative vaginal delivery, 3rd-/4th-degree perineal tears and further maternal and neonatal complications were considered as secondary outcomes.RESULTS: The CS rate dropped from 33.05 to 26.06% after starting the interventions (p < 0.01); in particular, the cumulative rate of CS performed during labor decreased significantly from 19.46 to 14.11% (p < 0.01). CS reduction was still statistically significant after multivariate correction (OR = 0.66, CI.95 = 0.57-0.76, p < 0.01). Results further showed an increased prevalence of 3rd-degree perineal tears (0.97% versus 2.24%, p < 0.01), present also after correcting for possible confounding factors (OR = 2.36, CI.95 = 1.48-3.76, p < 0.01). No differences were found in the rate of vaginal-operative births and further maternal complications, while the composite neonatal outcome was found to be improved (OR = 0.73, CI.95 = 0.57-0.93, p = 0.010).CONCLUSIONS: The introduction of multiple non-clinical interventions can significantly reduce the CS rate. However, beside an improvement in neonatal composite outcome, a potential increase in high-degree perineal tears should be taken in account.",

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate incidence, risk factors and causes of maternal near-misses (MNM) admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) within five years by using the World Health Organization's MNM approach.METHODS: A five-year retrospective study was conducted in Subei People's Hospital of Yangzhou, Jiangsu Province from January 1, 2015 to December 31, 2019. Risk factors in 65 women with MNM in the intensive care unit (ICU) were explored by using chi-square tests and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Causes and interventions in MNM were investigated by descriptive analysis.RESULTS: Average maternal near-miss incidence ratio (MNMIR) for ICU admission was 3.5 per 1000 live births. Average maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was 5 per 100,000 live births. MI for all MNM was 0.7%. Steady growth of MNMIR in ICU was witnessed in the five-year study period. Women who were referred from other hospitals (aOR 3.32; 95%CI 1.40-7.32) and had cesarean birth (aOR 4.96; 95%CI 1.66-14.86) were more likely to be admitted in ICU. Neonates born to women with MNM admitted in ICU had lower birthweight (aOR 5.41; 95%CI 2.53-11.58) and Apgar score at 5 min (aOR 6.39; 95%CI 2.20-18.55) compared with women with MNM outside ICU. ICU admission because of MNM occurred mostly postpartum (n = 63; 96.9%). Leading direct obstetric causes of MNM admitted in ICU were hypertensive diseases of pregnancy (n = 24; 36.9%), followed by postpartum hemorrhage (n = 14; 21.5%), while the leading indirect obstetric cause was heart diseases (n = 3; 4.6%).CONCLUSIONS: Risk factors that were associated with MNM in ICU were referral and cesarean birth. Hypertensive disease of pregnancy and postpartum hemorrhage were the main obstetric causes of MNM in ICU. These findings would provide guidance to improve professional skills of primary health care providers and encourage vaginal birth in the absence of medical indications for cesarean birth.",

Although reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) offers quick results, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is a more reliable method for disease classification and assessment. The rapid spread of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has triggered extensive research towards developing a COVID-19 detection toolkit. Recent studies have confirmed that the deep learning-based approach, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), provides an optimized solution for COVID-19 classification; however, they require substantial training data for learning features. Gathering this training data in a short period has been challenging during the pandemic. Therefore, this study proposes a new model of CNN and deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs) that classify CXR images into normal, pneumonia, and COVID-19. The proposed model contains eight convolutional layers, four max-pooling layers, and two fully connected layers, which provide better results than the existing pretrained methods (AlexNet and GoogLeNet). DCGAN performs two tasks: (1) generating synthetic/fake images to overcome the challenges of an imbalanced dataset and (2) extracting deep features of all images in the dataset. In addition, it enlarges the dataset and represents the characteristics of diversity to provide a good generalization effect. In the experimental analysis, we used four distinct publicly accessible datasets of chest X-ray images (COVID-19 X-ray, COVID Chest X-ray, COVID-19 Radiography, and CoronaHack-Chest X-Ray) to train and test the proposed CNN and the existing pretrained methods. Thereafter, the proposed CNN method was trained with the four datasets based on the DCGAN synthetic images, resulting in higher accuracy (94.8%, 96.6%, 98.5%, and 98.6%) than the existing pretrained models. The overall results suggest that the proposed DCGAN-CNN approach is a promising solution for efficient COVID-19 diagnosis.",

A wide variation of clinical presentations, treatment outcomes and morbidities have been reported.Methods: a retrospective study was conducted to review clinical characteristics and treatment outcomes of patients with acromegaly treated in King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between 2006 and 2018.Results: eighty-four patients (31 males and 53 females) were reviewed, mean age at diagnosis was 45.7 � 12.6 years (�SD), mean time of disease onset was 7.6 � 6.4 years and mean follow-up period was 7.8 � 5.3 years. The most common presenting symptoms were maxillofacial change (96.8%) and acral enlargement (94.7%). Hypertension (39.3%), diabetes mellitus (28.6%) and dyslipidemia (23.8%) were prevalent co-existing conditions. Four patients were identified having cancer at presentation; however, no additional malignancy was reported during the follow up. Most patients harbored macroadenomas, only 10 were found to have microadenomas. The outcomes of treatment were controlled disease in 70% of microadenoma and 64.9% of macroadenoma. Permanent loss of pituitary function was found in about 21.3% and there was one case reported of mortality. The logistic regression analysis for controlled disease outcome showed the IGF-I index after surgery was associated with controlled disease outcome with statistically significant result (P-value=0.006).Conclusion: our study offers descriptive clinical data of case series of acromegalic patients, which had favorable outcomes comparable with previous reports.

Pregnant adolescents are faced with the stronger dilemma of either terminating the unwanted pregnancy or keeping it. This discourse which is based on findings from empirical research in Accra Ghana aims at contributing to the usefulness of understanding the meaning and scope of autonomy when it comes to providing ethically grounded, and adolescent friendly, reproductive health care services to pregnant adolescents. The aim of this work was to document the meaning and determinants of autonomous decision making among pregnant adolescents in the James Town area of Accra, Ghana.Methods: thirty (30) semi-structured in depth interviews were conducted among adolescents who had been pregnant at least once, 23 in depth interviews among purposively selected stakeholders (parents, teachers, NGO staff working in reproductive health, community volunteers), and 8 focus group discussions among parents, teachers, adolescent students who had not been pregnant before, and adolescents who had at least one pregnancy in the past. Data were transcribed verbatim and analyzed thematically.Results: most adolescents reported that the final decision to continue a pregnancy to term or go in for an abortion was taken by them. The partner?s willingness to take responsibility of the pregnant adolescent and baby, as well as financial considerations, were main players in deciding upon the pregnancy outcomes. Cultural desirability for children and health care provider/father paternalism (power dynamics) in the decision-making process were central considerations in the decision-making process. Unaffordable and unfriendly safe abortion services pushed adolescents to either continue pregnancies to term against their will, or opt to visit unsafe abortion care providers.Conclusion: adolescents stand to make truly autonomous decisions if they are provided with the right information, at the right time, at the right place, by the right persons, and in the right way. Health system, economic, and cultural factors play significant roles in rendering pregnant adolescent autonomy meaningful when deciding upon their pregnancy outcomes. Continuing pregnancies to term against one?s will or being forced to go in for an abortion are ethically unjustified. Further research is required to examine the long-term consequences of forced pregnancy terminations or births.",

Certain indications in pregnancy, guide the obstetrician as to which obstetric scan deems appropriate. The full realization of the benefits of ultrasound depends on whether it is being used appropriately or not, and hence this study aimed at auditing for the appropriate indications for obstetric ultrasound.Methods: a review of all request forms for obstetric scan between June 2019 and July 2020 was performed to assess the appropriateness of requests for obstetric ultrasound at the Cape Coast Teaching Hospital. The data obtained was analyzed using SPSS (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL version 20.0). A Chi-squared test of independence was used to check for statistically significant differences between variables at p ? 0.05.Results: three hundred and fourteen (314) out of the 527 request forms had clinical indications stated. 174 (81.7%) of requests from Cape Coast Teaching Hospital and 39 (18.3%) from other health centers did not indicate patients clinical history/indication on the request forms. Majority 76 (68.5%) of scans in the first trimester were done without indications/history. Only 29 of requests with clinical history were inappropriate.Conclusion: practitioners should be mindful of adequately completing request forms for obstetric investigations since a large number of practitioners do not state the history/indications for the scans. There should be continuous medical education on the importance of appropriate indication for obstetric ultrasound.",

Intrapartum stillbirths occurring in the health facilities imply that a foetus was alive on admission to labour and had greater chances of survival with optimum obstetric care. Active monitoring and follow-up by skilled birth attendants becomes critical to determine the progress of labour and to decide any emergency obstetrical care actions. Timely monitoring of labour progress indicators including fetal heart rate (FHR), uterine contraction maternal vital signs, vaginal examination (VE) are vital in reducing intrapartum stillbirth.Methods: a case-control study was conducted using primary data from chart review of medical records of women who experienced intrapartum stillbirth in 20 public health centres and 3 public hospitals of Addis Ababa between July 1st, 2010 to June 30th, 2015. Data were collected from charts of all cases of intrapartum stillbirths meeting the inclusion criteria and randomly selected charts of controls from each public health facility in 2: 1 control to case ratio.Results: over 90% of both cases and controls received FHR monitoring care albeit the timing was substandard. More women in the live birth group than intrapartum stillbirth group received timely care related to uterine contraction (OR 2.42, 95% CI 1.77 - 3.30) and blood pressure monitoring (aOR 1.41, 95% CI 1.09 - 1.81). 1.2% and 0.3% of women in the intrapartum stillbirth and livebirth groups developed eclampsia respectively.Conclusion: substandard timing and application of labour monitoring interventions including FHR, uterine contraction can predict intrapartum stillbirth in public health facilities.",

We made a quantitative descriptive estimate of 100 sexual active patients followed up for non-metastatic breast cancer, met during their consultations with a gynaecologist at the Farhat Hached hospital in Sousse. Data collection was carried out using an information sheet and two validated scales: RSS (relation Ship and sexual) and BESAA (Body EsteemScale for adolescents and Adults) to assess the quality of sexual life and body image. The average age of patients was 53.8 years. About half of patients (48%) had impaired sexuality due to the disease. The frequency of intercourse, sexual desire and the ability to reach orgasm were decreased in 65. 45, and 54 patients, respectively. The overall score for the three body image dimensions was 49.4. Women aged between 35 and 39 years were significantly more afraid of sexual intercourse (p=0.002) and less of sexual frequency (p=0.004). Adequate and enhanced training focused on the management of women with cancer and their sexual problems and multidisciplinary approach can improve women's psychological status.",

Infected individuals will seek aid at various health care facilities. Many patients will recover without requiring specialised treatment. A significant percentage of infected individuals will need critical care management, which will begin in the emergency department, generally staffed by junior doctors. Junior doctors will need to stabilize, triage and manage these patients prior to referral to specialized units. Above and beyond the usual occupational demands that accompany junior doctors in state facilities, this pandemic will thrust further responsibility on them. The objectives were to describe crisis preparedness of junior doctors in the areas of triage decision-making and critical care management, outside the intensive care unit.Methods: this is a descriptive, cross-sectional study, utilizing a web-based survey. Junior doctors in South Africa, being doctors in year one or year two of internship and community service, were invited to participate anonymously via various social media platforms. Results: a total of 210 junior doctors across South Africa answered the survey. Junior doctors expressed confidence with knowledge of intubation drugs, to perform intubation and cardiopulmonary arrest resuscitation without supervision. Only 13.3% of respondents expressed comfort with setting and adjusting ventilator settings independently. 57% of participants expressed discomfort with making critical care triage decisions. Ninety-three percent (93%) of participants expressed benefit from a telemedicine intervention.Conclusion: junior doctors in South Africa indicate that they are prepared to initiate management of the critically ill patient outside the intensive care unit but remain uncertain in their ability to provide ongoing critical care management. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need to prepare junior doctors with the ability to manage critical care triage and management in emergency rooms. Leveraging of the workforce in South Africa may be potentiated by telemedicine interventions.",

Variables collated were sociodemographic, primary indication, comorbidities, Aronchick bowel preparation scale, polyp/adenoma detection, caecal intubation and outcome. Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS version 20.Results: one hundred and twenty-four patients received PEG prior to colonoscopy and SPMC in 175 patients. The age range was from 22 to 92 years; mean age of 53.8 � 14.2 years for PEG group and 55.3 � 13.2 years for SPMC group (p=0.361). There were 215 males and 84 females. An excellent/good bowel preparation scale was recorded in 77 (62%) PEG group and 130 (74.3%) for SPMC group (p=0.592). PEG was predominantly used in the early years of endoscopists practice with the odds ratio (OR) of no polyp detection in the PEG vs SPMC groups as 1.64 (confidence interval CI 1.06-2.55) versus 0.76 (CI 0.62-0.92), respectively (p=0.016). For no adenoma detection, OR was 4.18 (CI 1.12-15.60) versus OR 0.63 (CI 0.52-0.75), respectively (p=0.012).Conclusion: there is similar efficacy profile using either split volume PEG or SPMC prior to colonoscopy in these African patients.

The objective of this study was to provide information on some harmful constituents of neffa and to use them for cancer risk assessment.Methods: a high-performance liquid chromatography method coupled with fluorescence detector was used to determine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in one sample of neffa. An atomic absorption spectrometry was performed to determine the concentrations of lead and cadmium in three samples of neffa. The levels of toxicants found in neffa were used to assess for lifetime cancer risk as advocated by the US Environment Protection Agency.Results: the determination of PAHs in neffa allowed the identification of phenanthrene and anthracene. However, the higher molecular weight PAHs such as Benzo(a)Pyrene B(a)P were not detected. The concentrations of cadmium and lead varied between 1.3 to 2.8�g/g and 1.7 to 4.6�g/g respectively. Cancer risk for cadmium and lead varied between 4.2E-03 to 9.3E-03 and 2.5E-06 to 6.4E-06 respectively. Cancer risk for Cd exceeded the range of 10E-04 to 10E-06 of an acceptable risk.Conclusion: neffa is not a healthy alternative for overcoming smoking addiction.

This exponential case rise was accompanied by an increase in the absolute number of case fatalities, with a corresponding strain on the public health sector. To effectively inform public health responses, policy and strategy to deal with the current wave and prepare for further waves, we discuss the drivers and challenges of control for this current wave and future waves, and offer practical recommendations. Vaccination will be the most important public health intervention to deal with the spread, morbidity and mortality of COVID-19, therefore, efforts to fight vaccine hesitancy and build vaccine confidence and availability will be critical. Similarly, it will be important to build public health sector capacity and resilience to adequately deal with large-scale outbreaks and absorb the shock waves associated with such. Resuscitating and building the economy is an indispensable component of protecting public health. Therefore, collaborative efforts from relevant public health stakeholders, economists, politicians and other players are required to effectively coordinate the necessary responses and formulate the right policies and strategies.",

This study piloted this concept.Methods: in this prospective, cohort study, 98 WLHIV had HPV and VIA screening for cervical precancer lesions in a HIV clinic in Nigeria. Participants positive to HPV and/or VIA had biopsies from the visible lesions or quadrant of transformation zone. Participants positive to VIA and/or HPV16 or HPV18/45 had same-day thermal ablation treatment and the number of cases documented. The HPV, VIA and scenario of HPV followed by VIA results were compared with histologically confirmed cervical lesion grade 2 or worse statistically.Results: same day treatment was achieved in 95.0% of eligible cases. Statistically, sensitivity and specificity of VIA was 25.0% and 50.0% and HPV had 95.5% and 75.0%, respectively. In the HPV screening with VIA triage, sensitivity dropped to 45.5% but specificity improved to 100.0%.Conclusion: triaging HPV positive test with VIA for same-day treatment in cervical precancer screening among PLWHIV looks feasible. The improved specificity will reduce the overtreatment rate, loss to follow-up associated with repeat clinic visits and improve completion of continuum of care.",

This study audited Letsholathebe II Memorial Hospital (LIIMH) professionals? usage of MHCA forms.Methods: this was a quasi-experimental study that audited files of patients admitted with mental illnesses, before, three and six months after a continuing medical education (CME). Cochran Q, McNemar symmetry Chi-square were used for comparison of performance.Results: of the 239 eligible files, we accessed 235 (98.3%). About two in ten (n=36/235, 15.3%) MHCA forms were not used in combination with required forms. The quasi-majority of MHCA forms set used, aligned with involuntary admission (n=134/137, 97.8%). Required admission MHCA forms significantly increased from nil before continuing medical education (CME-0), to 64.6% (n=51/79) at CME-3 and 77% (n=59/77) at CME-6 (p<0.001). However, there was no statistical difference between the last two periods (64.6% vs 77%, p=0.164). Voluntary admission remained below 13% (n=10/79). Only six types of MHCA forms were used during this study.Conclusion: there was no adequate use of required MHCA forms at LIIMH before CME. Thereafter, the proportion of adequate use increased from period CME-0 to the periods CME-3 and CME-6. However, there was no difference in proportion between the last two periods. We recommend an effective and regular CME twice a year for health professionals on selected MHCA forms.",

The data were compared between two groups (viral AH and non-viral AH).Results: one hundred and three patient?s files were included. The average age of our patients was 30.15 years. An etiology was found in 92 patients (89.3%). The viral etiology was found in 70 patients (76.1%). Hepatitis A virus (HAV), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) were in the cause in 52, 16, 1 and 1 patient respectively. Elsewhere, it was toxic hepatitis in 10 patients (10.9%) including 7 of drug-related AH. Budd-Chiari syndrome and autoimmune hepatitis with acute onset were reported in 3 (3.3%) and 7 (7.6%) patients, respectively. Patients with viral AH were younger than those with non-viral AH (p = 10-3). There was more recourse to hospitalization for non-viral AH. Patients with viral AH had a higher mean aminotransferase (ALT) level than those with non-viral AH. The liver damage was more severe in the non-viral AH group with lower PT. There was more severe form, more transition to chronicity and more deaths in the non-viral AH group. Conclusion: the results found in our study concerning the distribution of the etiologies of AH as well as their evolutionary aspects are consistent with the data in the literature.",

Immunohistochemical staining for p16INK4a can reduce inter-observer disagreement. We did a cross-sectional study to evaluate the utility of p16INK4a staining in the assessment of cervical biopsies in Nairobi, Kenya.Methods: hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections from 91 colposcopic biopsies diagnosed as negative for dysplasia or as cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 1-3 from 2011-2013 in Nairobi, Kenya, were reviewed and immunostained for p16INK4a. Agreement in interpretation of cervical biopsies was compared between primary and consensus review results.Results: on primary evaluation, 16 cases were negative for squamous dysplasia; 23 were CIN 1; 37 CIN 2; and 15 CIN 3. On consensus review, 32 cases were negative for dysplasia; 19 were CIN 1; 16 CIN 2 and 24 CIN 3. Agreement was moderate between primary and consensus histology review results for the diagnosis of low-grade versus high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (Kappa = 0.568). None of the cases negative for dysplasia were positive for p16INK4a expression, but in primary and consensus review results, 17% and 5% cases of CIN 1; 49% and 69% of CIN 2, and 80% and 96% of CIN 3 were p16INK4a positive, respectively.Conclusion: there was significant variability in the interpretation of cervical biopsies on hematoxylin and eosin between primary and consensus review assessments. 75% of CIN 1 cases that were upgraded to CIN 2 during consensus review expressed p16INK4a. These findings demonstrate the role of p16INK4a in increasing diagnostic accuracy and as a marker of high-grade CIN 2/3.",

This study assessed adherence to medication administration guidelines among nurses in a health facility in South-West Nigeria.Methods: a cross-sectional descriptive study was carried out on 75 nurses involved in oral medication administration. Data was collected using direct observation method with an observational checklist developed from literature. Data analysis was done using frequency, percentage, Mean and Standard Deviation. Test of relationship was carried out using Kruskal-Wallis Test and Mann Whitney Test at 0.05 (p<0.05) level of significance.Results: almost an average (49.3%) of participants did not provide information about the medication. More than 1/3rd (38.7%) did not perform right assessment where necessary. The majority (76.0%) did not serve correct medication. Overall level of non-adherence was 48%. Adherence to medication administration guidelines was significantly related to age (�2 = 9.673, p<0.05), marital status (�2 = 9.426, p<0.05), years of experience (U=404.000 Z=2.7622, p<0.05), type of shift (�2 = 6.314, p<0.05), nurses-patient ratio (�2 = 11.598, p<0.05).Conclusion: some nurses did not adhere strictly to the guidelines of medication administration. Adherence to medication administration guidelines was related to age, marital status, years of experience, type of shift and nurse-patient ratio. Poor adherence to medication administration guidelines may jeopardize patient safety. There is need for development of a universal medication procedure/protocol and continuous education of nurses on medication administration practices.",

The high complexity and cost of genotyping assays limits routine testing in many resource limited settings (RLS). We assessed the performance of a rapid HIV-1 drug resistance assay, the Pan Degenerate Amplification and Adaptation (PANDAA) assay when screening for significant HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (DRMs) such as K65R, K103NS, M184VI, Y181C and G190A. Methods: we used previously generated amplicons from a cross-sectional study conducted between October 2018 and February 2020 of HIV-1 infected antiretroviral therapy (ART)-na?ve or those reinitiating 1st line ART (18 years or older). The performance of the PANDAA assay in screening K65R, K103NS, M184VI, Y181C, and G190A mutations compared to the reference assay, Sanger sequencing was evaluated by Cohen?s kappa coefficient on Stata version 14 (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA).Results: one hundred and twenty samples previously characterized by Sanger sequencing were assessed using PANDAA. PDR was found in 14% (17/120). PDR to non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was higher at 13% (16/120) than PDR to nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), 3% (3/120). The PANDAA assay showed a strong agreement with the reference assay, i.e. Sanger sequencing for all five target DRMs (kappa (95%CI); 0.93 (0.78-0.98)) and NNRTI DRMs (kappa (95%CI); 0.93 (0.77-0.980), and a perfect agreement for NRTI DRMs (kappa (95%CI); 1.00 (0.54-1.00)).Conclusion: the PANDAA assay is a simple and rapid method to identify significant HIV DRMs in plasma samples as an alternative to Sanger sequencing in many RLS.",

Its roots are used to treat various health conditions ranging from mouth infections to urinary retention. Despite its medicinal application, there is no known knowledge of its therapeutic properties. Thus, we investigated the phytochemical content and antibacterial activity of M. macrantha.Methods: M. macrantha root extracts were obtained using three different solvents (distilled water, methanol and acetone) - in the soxhlet and maceration extraction methods. Total phytochemical (terpenoid, alkaloid and/or flavonoid) content was determined by spectrophotometry. Antibacterial activity against common foodborne pathogens (Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi) was determined by both well and disc diffusion method.Results: we detected the presence of all the tested phytochemicals. Methanol gave the highest percentage yield of extraction (mean: 13.95 � standard deviation: 0.41%) followed by water (10.92 � 0.11%) and acetone (6.85 � 0.23%), F-ratio=326.71 and p<0.0003. The total content determined showed that M. macrantha root extract contained more flavonoids than alkaloids (mg of standard per grams of the dry material). Antibacterial analyses showed inhibitory activity against all the selected pathogens, with the highest inhibition zone against S. typhi (19.7 � 0.3 mm) - for the acetone-prepared root extract. There were variations in minimum inhibitory concentrations of the extracts prepared by the different solvents.Conclusion: this is the first study demonstrating the presence of phytochemicals and antibacterial properties of M. macrantha roots. Further studies are needed to isolate and characterize the phytochemicals for antibacterial application.",

We calculated the traditional descriptive statistics and used the linear regression analysis for modeling. The work was performed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 26.0 and the R 3.6.0 (RStudio) software.Results: Manifestations of the COVID-19 epidemic process in several countries were studied; special attention was put to the number of deaths associated with the infection. A significant proportion of severe cases were noted among patients both in Russia and elsewhere. Considering that the disease incidence has reached its peak in China and Italy, we were able to improve the previously published (Sovremennye tehnologii v medicine 2020, Vol. 12, No.2) regression models and to compare their performance. The first modified model is based on the absolute increase in new cases of the infection: its regression coefficient is 0.16 (95% CI 0.137-0.181). In the extended version of the updated model, we additionally considered cases of aggravated COVID-19: the regression coefficients were 0.128 (95% CI 0.103-0.153) for model 2 and 0.053 (95% CI 0.029-0.077) for model 1.1; p=0.0001.Conclusion: Based on the most recent data (from January to May 2020) on the incidence of COVID-19 in the world, we have developed more specific versions of the basic and extended regression models of lethal outcomes. The resulting models are optimized and extrapolated to the current epidemiological situation; they will allow us to improve our analytical approach.

The aim of the study was to determine the epidemiology of those viruses in randomly selected dairy farms of Addis Ababa.Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2018 to April 2019 using a probability proportional to size (PPS) sampling technique. A total of 110 calves, less than 30 days of age, from 57 dairy herds were involved in the study. Associated factors of herds and calves were collected using semistructured interviews from farm owners and through physical observation of selected calves. Fecal samples were collected and analyzed using the sandwich ELISA method. Data generated from both semistructured interviews and laboratory investigation were analyzed using STATA_MP version 15.Results: From the total 110 calves, 42 (38.18%) had diarrhea during the survey. The prevalence of bovine rotavirus and coronavirus was 3.64% (4/110) and 0.91% (1/110), respectively. Diarrhea, feeding colostrum timing, and sex of the neonatal calves had statistically significant association with bovine rotavirus infection (p < 0.05). All rotavirus-positive neonatal calves were identified in small scale dairy farms and in dairy farms that reported mortality though they lack statistically significant association. Only one coronavirus case was detected among the neonatal calves. The case was identified among small scale herds and in a herd with diarrheal cases. The sex of the coronavirus calf was female, diarrheic, and among 11-20 days old.Conclusion: The prevalence of rotavirus and coronavirus infections in neonatal calves was seldom in dairy farms of the study area. Rotavirus was more common than coronavirus, and further studies should be initiated on other (infectious and noninfectious) causes of neonatal calf diarrhea in the area.",

To effectively predict the progression of COVID-19 via patients' clinical features at an early stage, the prevalence of these clinical factors and their relationships with severe illness were assessed.Methods: In this study, electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Chinese database) were searched to obtain relevant studies, including information on severe patients. Publication bias analysis, sensitivity analysis, prevalence, sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratio, diagnosis odds ratio calculation, and visualization graphics were achieved through software Review Manager 5.3, Stata 15, Meta-DiSc 1.4, and R.Results: Data of 3.547 patients from 24 studies were included in this study. The results revealed that patients with chronic respiratory system diseases (pooled positive likelihood 6.07, 95% CI: 3.12-11.82), chronic renal disease (4.79, 2.04-11.25), cardiovascular disease (3.45, 2.19-5.44), and symptoms of the onset of chest tightness (3.8, 1.44-10.05), shortness of breath (3.18, 2.24-4.51), and diarrhea (2.04, 1.38-3.04) exhibited increased probability of progressing to severe illness. C-reactive protein, ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate increased a lot in severe patients compared to nonsevere. Yet, it was found that clinical features including fever, cough, and headache, as well as some comorbidities, have little warning value.Conclusions: The clinical features and laboratory examination could be used to estimate the process of infection in COVID-19 patients. The findings contribute to the more efficient prediction of serious illness for patients with COVID-19 to reduce mortality.",

Saliva-based SARS-CoV-2 tests provide the opportunity to leverage stored samples for assessing the oral microbiome. However, these collection kits have not been tested for their accuracy in measuring the oral microbiome. Saliva is highly enriched with human DNA and reducing it prior to shotgun sequencing may increase the depth of bacterial reads. We examined both the effect of saliva collection method and sequence processing on measurement of microbiome depth and diversity by 16S rRNA gene amplicon and shotgun metagenomics. We collected 56 samples from 22 subjects. Each subject provided saliva samples with and without preservative, and a subset provided a second set of samples the following day. 16S rRNA gene (V4) sequencing was performed on all samples, and shotgun metagenomics was performed on a subset of samples collected with preservative with and without human DNA depletion before sequencing. We observed that the beta diversity distances within subjects over time was smaller than between unrelated subjects, and distances within subjects were smaller in samples collected with preservative. Samples collected with preservative had higher alpha diversity measuring both richness and evenness. Human DNA depletion before extraction and shotgun sequencing yielded higher total and relative reads mapping to bacterial sequences. We conclude that collecting saliva with preservative may provide more consistent measures of the oral microbiome and depleting human DNA increases yield of bacterial sequences.",

Although RT-qPCR remains the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection, this method requires specialised equipment in a diagnostic laboratory and has a long turn-around time to process the samples. To address this, several groups have recently reported the development of loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) as a simple, low cost and rapid method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Herein we present a comparative analysis of three LAMP-based assays that target different regions of the SARS-CoV-2: ORF1ab RdRP, ORF1ab nsp3 and Gene N. We perform a detailed assessment of their sensitivity, kinetics and false positive rates for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics in LAMP or RT-LAMP reactions, using colorimetric or fluorescent detection. Our results independently validate that all three assays can detect SARS-CoV-2 in 30�min, with robust accuracy at detecting as little as 1000 RNA copies and the results can be visualised simply by color changes. Incorporation of RT-LAMP with fluorescent detection further increases the detection sensitivity to as little as 100 RNA copies. We also note the shortcomings of some LAMP-based assays, including variable results with shorter reaction time or lower load of SARS-CoV-2, and false positive results in some experimental conditions and clinical saliva samples. Overall for RT-LAMP detection, the ORF1ab RdRP and ORF1ab nsp3 assays have faster kinetics for detection but varying degrees of false positives detection, whereas the Gene N assay exhibits no false positives in 30�min reaction time, which highlights the importance of optimal primer design to minimise false-positives in RT-LAMP. This study provides validation of the performance of LAMP-based assays as a rapid, highly sensitive detection method for SARS-CoV-2, which have important implications in development of point-of-care diagnostics for SARS-CoV-2.",

At the beginning of the epidemic, people do not know about the virus, then, after the outbreak of epidemics and alarm, they begin to comply with the restrictions and the spreading of epidemics may decline. Over time, some people get tired/frustrated by the restrictions and stop following them (exhaustion), especially if the number of new cases drops down. After resting for a while, they can follow the restrictions again. But during this pause the second wave can come and become even stronger then the first one. Studies based on SIR models do not predict the observed quick exit from the first wave of epidemics. Social dynamics should be considered. The appearance of the second wave also depends on social factors. Many generalizations of the SIR model have been developed that take into account the weakening of immunity over time, the evolution of the virus, vaccination and other medical and biological details. However, these more sophisticated models do not explain the apparent differences in outbreak profiles between countries with different intrinsic socio-cultural features. In our work, a system of models of the COVID-19 pandemic is proposed, combining the dynamics of social stress with classical epidemic models. Social stress is described by the tools of sociophysics. The combination of a dynamic SIR-type model with the classical triad of stages of the general adaptation syndrome, alarm-resistance-exhaustion, makes it possible to describe with high accuracy the available statistical data for 13 countries. The sets of kinetic constants corresponding to optimal fit of model to data were found. These constants characterize the ability of society to mobilize efforts against epidemics and maintain this concentration over time and can further help in the development of management strategies specific to a particular society.",

Monthly telephone-based cross-sectional surveys in January-April 2020 and then weekly surveys from May through December 2020 were conducted to monitor changes in public risk perception of COVID-19, personal efficacy in self-protection, confidence in government's ability to control the pandemic, precautionary behaviours, perceived impact of precautionary behaviours, psychological fatigue and distress in Hong Kong, and examine their inter-relationships. While worry about contracting COVID-19 increased, personal efficacy and confidence in government declined as the community incidence of COVID-19 increased. The public maintained high compliance with most precautionary behaviours throughout but relaxed behaviours that were more challenging when disease incidence declined. Public confidence in government was persistently low throughout, of which, a lower level was associated with more psychological fatigue, lower compliance with precautionary behaviours and greater psychological distress. Perceived greater negative impact of precautionary behaviours was also associated with more psychological fatigue which in turn was associated with relaxation of precautionary behaviours. Female, younger and unemployed individuals reported greater psychological distress throughout different stages of the pandemic. Risk communication should focus on promoting confidence in self-protection and pandemic control to avoid helplessness to act when the pandemic resurges. Policy making should prioritize building public trust, enhancing support for sustaining precautionary behaviours, and helping vulnerable groups to adapt to the stress during the pandemic.",

Results: From this search, 3,077 studies were identified. 145 studies entered quantitative analysis [cancer and cancer screening (32/145), HIV (32/145), mental health (10/145), vaccination (8/145), and climate change (3/145)]. Ten studies entered final analysis [HIV/AIDs (5), climate change (1), sexual health (3), and croup (1)]. ST techniques included digital ST (DST), written ST, verbal ST, and use of professional writers. Of the ten studies, seven used ST to change KAB/P; the remainder used ST to extract insights. Follow-up and evaluation were very limited. Conclusion: ST reveals insights and serves as an intervention in public health. Benefits of ST largely outweigh the limitations, but more follow-up/evaluation is needed. ST should play a more significant role in tackling public health issues.

Our objectives were to understand (1) whether ERP associates with adverse outcomes in a multiethnic population and (2) to explore the role of LVM in these associations. Participants from the Dallas Heart Study with an electrocardiogram interpretable for ERP, defined as J�point elevation ?1�mm in 2 contiguous leads, were included. Combined all-cause mortality and nonfatal cardiovascular disease (CVD) events and individual components were assessed using Cox proportional hazards modeling after adjustment for demographics, traditional CVD risk factors, electrocardiogram intervals, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-derived factors. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging-defined LVM was then added to the most fully adjusted model. Of the 2,686 participants, 240 (8.9%) demonstrated ERP. Participants with ERP were more likely to be male and Black, with lower body mass index, greater left ventricular end-diastolic volumes, and LVM. Over a median follow-up of 11�years, the combined end point occurred in 326 patients. Multivariable modeling demonstrated ERP was associated with the combined end point (HR [95% CI] 1.61 [1.14 to 2.26]), all-cause mortality (1.67 [1.00 to 2.80]). However, further adjusting for LVM attenuated the associations of ERP with the primary end point (HR [95% CI] 1.22 [0.85 to 1.77]) and secondary end points of mortality (1.39 [0.80 to 2.41]) and nonfatal CVD (1.05 [0.68 to 1.64]). ERP was associated with increased mortality and nonfatal CVD events, which was attenuated after adjusting for LVM, a previously under-recognized clinical phenotype. Previous associations of ERP with adverse cardiovascular outcomes may be partially explained by greater LVM in those with ERP.",

Current guidelines recommend individualized treatment with consideration of risk scores. We sought to evaluate the degree of agreement in treatment recommendations and the ability to predict ischemic and bleeding complications of the PRECISE-DAPT (predicting bleeding complications in patients undergoing stent implantation and subsequent dual antiplatelet therapy) and DAPT scores. Consecutive patients receiving 12 months of DAPT were grouped based on score treatment recommendation at the time of PCI: PRECISE-DAPT prolonged or shortened (PRECISE DAPT <25 vs ?25) and DAPT prolonged or shortened (DAPT ?2 vs <2). One-year ischemic and bleeding outcomes were compared for each group. In 451 patients, the PRECISE-DAPT and DAPT score recommendations were concordant in 56.7% of patients (Cohen's kappa for agreement of k = 0.139, 95% confidence interval 0.065 to 0.212). There was no difference in composite major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events between patients with high versus low PRECISE-DAPT or DAPT scores. In patients with a high PRECISE-DAPT score versus a low score, there was an increased incidence of 1-year all-cause mortality (2.13% vs 0%, p = 0.04) and an increase in bleeding (Bleeding Academic Research Consortium ?3a: 17.0% vs 2.8%; p <0.001; Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3b/c and 5: 8.5% vs 1.4%; p = 0.001). There were no differences in rates of mortality or bleeding for patients with high versus low DAPT scores. In conclusion, when applied at the baseline, the PRECISE-DAPT and DAPT scores frequently make discordant DAPT duration recommendations. The PRECISE-DAPT, but not the DAPT score, demonstrated associations with all-cause mortality and bleeding in patients prescribed 12 months of DAPT after PCI.",

We evaluated this among participants aged 45 to 55�years from the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, and assessed whether additional biomarkers can identify subgroups at increased absolute risk. We included 1,407 participants (61% women) without diabetes or severe hypercholesterolemia, with estimated 10-year risk <20% and CAC�=�0. We evaluated all and hard cardiovascular disease (CVD) events, overall and among subjects with each of the following: high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels ?2�mg/L, homocysteine ?10��mol/L, high-sensitivity cardiac troponin T ?95th percentile, lipoprotein (a) >50�mg/dl, triglycerides ?175�mg/dl, apolipoprotein B ?130�mg/dl, albuminuria, thoracic aortic calcium, aortic valve calcium (AVC), mitral annular calcium, ankle-brachial index <0.9, any carotid plaque, and maximum internal carotid artery intima-media thickness (ICA-IMT) ?1.5�mm. Median follow-up was 16�years, and overall CVD event rates were low (4% at 15�years). For most exposures evaluated, rates of all CVD events were <6 per 1,000 person-years, except for ICA-IMT ?1.5�mm (6.43) and AVC (13.8). The number needed to screen to detect ICA-IMT ?1.5�mm was 8, and 84 for AVC. Among participants with borderline/intermediate risk or premature family history, hard CVD event rates were <7 per 1,000 for most exposures, except for ICA-IMT ?1.5�mm (8.25), albuminuria (8.30), and AVC (13.47). Nonsmokers and those with ICA-IMT <1.5�mm had very low rates. In conclusion, our results demonstrate a favorable long-term prognosis of CAC�=�0 among adults aged ?55 years, particularly among nonsmokers.

We extracted electronic health record data for patients with at least one primary care or cardiology visit between October 2018 and January 2020 at an urban, academic medical center in New York City. Clinical and demographic data were used to identify patients eligible for primary prevention statin therapy. Statin prescription status was extracted from the electronic health record, and multivariate logistic regression was used to assess the association between statin prescription and age, gender, race, ethnicity, and other clinical and demographic covariables. In 7,550 patients eligible for primary prevention statin therapy, 3,994 (52.9%) were prescribed statins on at least 1 visit. Statin prescription was highest in patients with diabetes mellitus (73.6%) and with a 10-year ASCVD risk ?20% (60.6%) and was lowest for those with a 10-year ASCVD risk between 5% and 7.5% (18.7%). Compared with those never prescribed statins, patients prescribed statins were less likely to be women, mainly driven by lower statin prescription rates for women with diabetes. In a fully adjusted model, women remained less likely to be prescribed statin therapy (adjusted odds ratios 0.79, 95% confidence interval 0.71 to 0.88). In conclusion, primary prevention statin therapy remains underutilized.",

Our objective was to analyze the reasons an electrophysiological study (EPS) was performed in an asymptomatic population referred for the procedure, and compare the results of catheter ablation between asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. Patients ?18�years of age with preexcitation referred for an EPS and ablation were grouped as either symptomatic or asymptomatic. We analyzed in both subsets for (1) reasons for the procedure, (2) EPS results (anterograde effective refractory period of the accessory pathway, tachycardia/atrial fibrillation inducibility, anatomical localization), (3) success of the procedure, and (4) incidence of complications. We included 175 patients, 121 of which were symptomatic (39 � 16 years) and 54 were asymptomatic (35 � 14 years, p = NS not significant). The most frequent symptoms were palpitations (87%) and syncope (7%). EPS was performed in 44 of 54 asymptomatic patients mainly because of involvement in sports (60%) or high-risk employment (14%). Anterograde effective refractory period was significantly longer in asymptomatic patients (314 � 55�milliseconds) than in symptomatic patients (278 � 46�milliseconds; p <0.001). Orthodromic tachycardia inducibility was significantly higher in symptomatic than in asymptomatic patients (69% and 27%, respectively; p <0.001). A total of 170 accessory pathways (49% left free wall, 12% right free wall, 39% septal) were observed without significant differences in the anatomical location between groups. Catheter ablation was attempted in all patients, succeeding in 98% of symptomatic and 95% of asymptomatic patients, without major complications in either group. In conclusion, the reasons for invasive evaluation of asymptomatic patients with preexcitation may be outside the scope of current guidelines. Catheter ablation produces excellent results without major complications.",

We used data from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study to examine the relation between large-scale proteomics and incident AF in a cohort of older-aged adults in the United States. We quantified 4,877 plasma proteins in Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities participants at visit 5 (2011-2013) using an aptamer-based proteomic profiling platform. We used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between protein levels and incident AF, and explored relation of selected protein biomarkers using annotated pathway analysis. Our study included 4,668 AF-free participants (mean age 75 � 5 years; 59% female; 20% Black race) with proteomic measures. A total of 585 participants developed AF over a mean follow-up of 5.7 � 1.7 years. After adjustment for clinical factors associated with AF, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) was associated with the risk of incident AF (hazard ratio, 1.82; 95% CI, 1.68 to 1.98; p, 2.91�?�10-45 per doubling of NT-proBNP). In addition, 36 other proteins were also significantly associated with incident AF after Bonferroni correction. We further adjusted for medication use and estimated glomerular filtration rate and found 17 proteins, including angiopoietin-2 and transgelin, that remained significantly associated with incident AF. Pathway analyses implicated the inhibition of matrix metalloproteases as the top canonical pathway in AF pathogenesis. In conclusion, using a large-scale proteomic platform, we identified both novel and established proteins associated with incident AF and explored mechanistic pathways of AF development.",

Nevertheless, the impact of T2MI on hypertensive crisis outcome is poorly understood due to limited data. This study was a retrospective analysis of the National Readmission Database year 2018. Patients were included if the primary diagnosis was hypertensive crisis, hypertensive urgency, or hypertensive emergency. Patients were excluded if they had type 1 myocardial infarction (T1MI), severe sepsis, septic shock, gastrointestinal bleeding, or hemorrhagic anemia at index admission. The primary outcome was 90-day readmission with T1MI. Secondary outcomes were in-hospital mortality, length of stay, resource utilization, and all-cause 90-day readmission. Subgroup analysis was done according to urgency and emergency presentation. A total of 101,211 index hospitalizations were included in our cohort, of whom 3,644 (3.6%) received a diagnosis of T2MI. A total of 912 patients were readmitted within 90 days with T1MI. T2MI was an independent predictor of 90-day readmission with T1MI (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 2.64, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.90 to 3.66, p <0.01).

However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the incidence, prognostic impact, and evolution of RVD in patients treated with transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). All patients treated with TAVI for severe aortic stenosis were included in a prospective single-center database. Patients who had a quantitative assessment of right ventricular (RV) function including tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and/or Doppler tissue imaging-derived tricuspid lateral annular systolic velocity (S' wave) measurements were eligible for this study. RVD was defined as TAPSE <17 mm or S' <9.5 cm/s if TAPSE was not available. Between 2014 and 2019, 503 patients with RV function assessment were included. The incidence of RVD before TAVI was 18.7%. Predictors of RVD were diabetes (p�=�0.03), atrial fibrillation (p�=�0.001), impaired left ventricular ejection fraction (p <0.0001), left ventricular dilatation (p�=�0.007), and previous cardiac surgery (p�=�0.002). Long-term survival was worse in patients with RVD before TAVI compared with those without RVD (hazard ratio 1.97, 95% confidence interval 1.1 to 3.4, p�=�0.01). One year after TAVI, 58.7% of patients with baseline RVD had normal RV function and had similar outcomes as compared with those without RVD at baseline. In contrast, patients with persistent RVD had the worst prognosis. In conclusion, RVD is not rare and has a deleterious prognostic impact in patients treated with TAVI. Recovery of normal RV function is frequent after TAVI, whereas persistence of RVD is associated with poor outcomes.",

Mitral regurgitation (MR) grade, functional status (New York Heart Association class), and major adverse cardiac events (MACE; all-cause mortality or hospitalization for heart failure) were evaluated in 52 patients with A-FMR and in 307 patients with V-FMR. In 56 patients, hemodynamic assessment during exercise echocardiography was performed before and 6 months after intervention. MR reduction after MitraClip implantation was noninferior in A-FMR compared with V-FMR (MR grade ?2 at 6 months in 94% vs 82%, respectively, p <0.001 for noninferiority) and was associated with improvement of functional status (New York Heart Association class ?2 at 6 months in 90% vs 80%, respectively, p = 0.2). Hemodynamic assessment revealed that cardiac output at 6 months was higher in A-FMR at rest (5.1 � 1.5 L/min vs 3.8 � 1.5 L/min, p = 0.002) and during peak exercise (7.9 � 2.4 L/min vs 6.1 � 2.1 L/min, p = 0.02). In addition, the reduction in systolic pulmonary artery pressure at rest was more pronounced in A-FMR: � SPAP -13.1 � 15.1 mm Hg versus -2.2 � 13.3 mm Hg (p = 0.03). MACE rate at follow-up was significantly lower in A-FMR versus V-FMR, with an adjusted odds ratio of 0.46 (95% confidence interval 0.24 to 0.88), which was caused by a reduction in hospitalization for heart failure. In conclusion, percutaneous edge-to-edge mitral valve repair with MitraClip is at least as effective in A-FMR as in V-FMR in reducing MR. However, the hemodynamic improvement and reduction of MACE were significantly better in A-FMR.",

We sought to identify the incidence, risk factors, and survival among patients who developed acute kidney injury (AKI) after the Fontan operation. We retrospectively reviewed 1,166 patients who had Fontan operation/revision at Mayo Clinic Rochester from 1973 to 2017 and identified patients who had AKI (defined by AKI Network criteria) within 7�days of surgery. A total of 132 patients (11%) developed AKI after the Fontan operation with no significant era effect. Of those who developed AKI, severe (grade 3) kidney injury was present in 101 patients (76.5%). Multivariable risk factors for AKI were asplenia (odds ratio [OR] 4.2, p <0.0001), elevated preoperative pulmonary artery pressure (per 1 mm Hg increase, OR 1.04, p�=�0.0002), intraoperative arrhythmias (OR 1.9, p�=�0.02), and elevated post-bypass Fontan pressure (per 1 mm Hg increase, OR 1.12, p�=�0.0007). Renal replacement therapy (RRT) was used in 72 patients (54%), predominantly through peritoneal dialysis (n�=�56, 78%). Multivariable risk factors for RRT were age ?3�years (OR 9.7, p�=�0.0004), female gender (OR 2.6, p�=�0.02), and aortic cross-clamp time >60�minutes (OR 3.1, p�=�0.01). Patients with AKI had more postoperative complications, including bleeding, stroke, pericardial tamponade, low cardiac output state and cardiac arrest, than those without AKI. This resulted in longer intensive care unit stay (39 vs 17�days, p�=�0.0001). In-hospital mortality was exceedingly higher among patients with AKI versus no AKI (58%, 76 of 132 vs 10%, 99 of 1,034, p <0.0001); however, there was no significant difference based on the need for RRT. Recovery from AKI was observed in 56 patients (42%). Over 20-year follow-up, patients with AKI had a distinctly higher all-cause-mortality (82%) than those without AKI (35%). It is prudent to identity patients at a higher risk of developing postoperative AKI after Fontan operation to ensure renal protective strategies in the perioperative period. Postoperative AKI leads to substantial short and long-term morbidity and mortality, but the need for RRT does not affect the outcomes.",

Cases enrolling in the study were divided into two groups. While those in the first group had a history of SARS-CoV-2 infection (n�=�46) the second group consisted of healthy pregnant women (n�=�70).RESULTS: Emergency Cesarean section was performed on three SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnancies (30, 33 and 34 gestational weeks). Intensive care unit admission was required for all three cases after delivery and two of them died. Among the pregnancies that had an infection in the third trimester, 71.4% (n�=�20) of them had delivery in 14 days after diagnosis and 17.4% (n�=�8) of their newborns were followed up at newborn intensive care unit. Overall, only one newborn had a positive swab test result for SARS-CoV-2. There was no statistically significant difference between groups regarding their delivery week (37.02���5.85 vs 38.5���2.33). Similarly, there was no significant difference between groups, concerning mean age, parity, and birth weight (P�=�0.707, P�=�0.092, P�=�0.334; P�<�0.05). Furthermore, the difference between SARS-CoV-2 infected pregnancies that were followed up as inpatient or outpatient with respect to the delivery week and birth weight was not significant (p�>�0.05). Also, APGAR 5 scores of hospitalized women (9.3���1.1) were found to be lower than the outpatient group (9.8���0.8) (P�=�0.043; p�<�0.05).CONCLUSION: No significant difference was detected between groups in terms of the delivery week, birth weight, and APGAR scores. The inpatient group was found to have lower APGAR 5 scores.",

Episodes were classified by the increasing length and intensity of opioid use (acute (lasting <90 episode days), episodic (lasting ?90 episode days; with <90 days' drug supply and/or <50% episode intensity), and chronic (lasting ?90 episode days; with ?90 days' drug supply and ?50% episode intensity)). People with a chronic episode were matched 1:1:1:1 on socioeconomic variables to those with episodic or acute episodes and to those who were opioid naive. IDU initiation was identified by a validated administrative algorithm with high specificity. Cox models weighted by inverse probability of treatment weights assessed the association between opioid use category (chronic, episodic, acute, opioid naive) and IDU initiation.RESULTS: 59 804 participants (14 951 people from each opioid use category) were included in the matched cohort, and followed for a median of 5.8 years. 1149 participants initiated IDU. Cumulative probability of IDU initiation at five years was highest for participants with chronic opioid use (4.0%), followed by those with episodic use (1.3%) and acute use (0.7%), and those who were opioid naive (0.4%). In the inverse probability of treatment weighted Cox model, risk of IDU initiation was 8.4 times higher for those with chronic opioid use versus those who were opioid naive (95% confidence interval 6.4 to 10.9). In a sensitivity analysis limited to individuals with a history of chronic pain, cumulative risk for those with chronic use (3.4% within five years) was lower than the primary results, but the relative risk was not (hazard ratio 9.7 (95% confidence interval 6.5 to 14.5)). IDU initiation was more frequent at higher opioid doses and younger ages.CONCLUSIONS: The rate of IDU initiation among individuals who received chronic prescription opioid treatment for non-cancer pain was infrequent overall (3-4% within five years) but about eight times higher than among opioid naive individuals. These findings could have implications for strategies to prevent IDU initiation, but should not be used as a reason to support involuntary tapering or discontinuation of long term prescription opioid treatment.",

Main inclusion criteria were 1) peer-reviewed, quantitative, English-language articles published from 1980; (2) studies investigating depression, anxiety, PTSD, or OCD among parents following stillbirth; and (3) studies defining stillbirth as equal to or after 20 weeks of gestation.RESULTS: Thirteen quantitative, peer-reviewed articles were eligible for inclusion. Selected articles investigated depression, anxiety, and PTSD, while no studies on OCD met our inclusion criteria. The majority of studies investigated women, while only two studies included men. The results indicated heightened short- and long-term levels of depression, anxiety, and PTSD in parents after stillbirth compared to those of parents with live birth. Studies investigating predictors found that social support, marital status, negative appraisals, and variables related to care and management after stillbirth affected levels of symptoms.CONCLUSIONS: Parents who experience stillbirth have a considerably higher risk of reporting symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD compared with parents with live births. More longitudinal studies are needed to increase our knowledge of how symptoms develop over time, and more research on fathers, transgender, non-binary and gender fluid individuals is needed. Research on the association between stillbirth and OCD is also warranted. Knowledge of the severity of anxiety, depression, and PTSD after stillbirth, and predictors associated with symptom severity could provide healthcare professionals with valuable information on how to provide beneficial postpartum care.",

Several interventional trials showed that application of a care bundle involving a hands-on approach to perineal protection may reduce the risk of OASI. Previously, we found that only the element \"hand on the fetal head\" in itself was protective, although the risk of a type 2 error was calculated to be 50%.METHODS: A prospective follow-up study in an obstetric department in Denmark with 3200 deliveries per year. We included a cohort of 10,383 women giving birth vaginally from gestational week 22 + 0 from 2016 through 2019. We documented on a person-level the five elements of the care bundle together with maternal and obstetrical characteristics. The elements were 1) communication, 2) visible perineum, 3) hand on fetal head, 4) perineal support and 5) certification. Regression analysis was used for analysis of associations. The primary outcome measure was OASI.RESULTS: The total rate of OASI in vaginally delivering women was 1.9%. The incidence was 3.2% in nulliparous women giving birth vaginally. The rate of cesarean section was 16.5% and for episiotomy 2.4%. The reduction in the incidence of OASI was sustained since 2013. Hand on the fetal head and perineal support both were protective factors for OASI. In case of a nulliparous woman with a neonate weighing 3500 g giving birth spontaneously, the relative risk (RR) for OASI was 0.50 (95% CI 0.49- 0.51) with use of hand on the fetal head together with perineal support against no use. Similarly, with a nulliparous woman giving birth to a neonate of 3500 g by vacuum extraction, the RR for OASI was 0.65 (95% CI 0.62-0.68) against no use.CONCLUSIONS: Both hand on the fetal head and perineal support were associated with a reduced risk of OASI.",

Certain regions of the globe were severely affected in terms of prevalence and mortality than other. Although the cause for this pattern is not clearly understood, lessons learned from previous epidemics and emerging evidences suggest the major role of ecological factors like ambient air pollutants (AAP) and meteorological parameters in increased COVID-19 incidence. The present study aimed to understand the impact of these factors on SARS-CoV-2 transmission and their associated mortality in major cities of India.METHODS: This study used secondary AAP, meteorological and COVID-19 data from official websites for the period January-November 2020, which were divided into Pre-lockdown (January-March 2020), Phase I (April to June 2020) and Phase II (July to November 2020) in India. After comprehensive screening, five major cities that includes 48 CPCB monitoring stations collecting daily data of ambient temperature, particulate matter PM2.5 and 10 were analysed. Spearman and Kendall's rank correlation test was performed to understand the association between SARS-CoV-2 transmission and AAP and, meteorological variables. Similarly, case fatality rate (CFR) was determined to compute the correlation between AAP and COVID-19 related morality.RESULTS: The level of air pollutants in major cities were significantly reduced during Phase I compared to Pre-lock down and increased upon Phase II in all the cities. During the Phase II in Delhi, the strong significant positive correlation was observed between the AAP and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. However, in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai AAP levels were moderate and no correlation was noticed. The relation between AT and SARS-CoV-2 transmission was inconclusive as both positive and negative correlation observed. In addition, Delhi and Kolkata showed a positive association between long-term exposure to the AAP and COVID-19 CFR.CONCLUSION: Our findings support the hypothesis that the particulate matter upon exceeding the satisfactory level serves as an important cofactor in increasing the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission and related mortality. These findings would help public health experts to understand the SARS-CoV-2 transmission against ecological variables in India and provides supporting evidence to healthcare policymakers and government agencies for formulating strategies to combat the COVID-19.",

We followed a prospective cohort of patients admitted in hospital wards with moderate COVID-19 disease, including those with a history of kidney transplantation, and examined the ability of changes in routine hematologic laboratory parameters to predict and mirror the patients' clinical course regarding the severity of their condition (classified as critical vs. non-critical) and in-hospital mortality or hospital discharge. Among the 68 patients, 20 (29%) were kidney transplanted patients (KT), and they had much higher mortality than non-kidney transplanted patients in this cohort (40% X 8.3%). Lymphocytes, neutrophils and neutrophils/lymphocytes ratio (NLR) at admission and platelets as well as the red blood cells parameters hemoglobin, hematocrit, and RDW by the time of hospital discharge or death clearly differentiated patients progressing to critical disease and those with clinical recovery. Patients with deteriorating clinical courses presented elevated and similar NLRs during the first week of hospitalization. However, they were dramatically different at hospital discharge, with a decrease in the survivors (NLR around 5.5) and sustained elevation in non-survivors (NLR around 21). Platelets also could distinguish survivors from non-survivors among the critical patients. In conclusion, routine hematologic tests are useful to monitor the clinical course of COVID-19 patients admitted with moderate disease. Unexpectedly, changes in hematologic tests, including lymphopenia, were not predictive of complicated outcomes among KT recipients.",

Vaccination of the elderly and chronically ill was prioritized and the interval between doses set to 12 weeks. The objective of this interim analysis was to evaluate first and second dose vaccine effectiveness (VE) in a real-world setting.METHODS: During the first five months of the campaign, a register-based cohort study was conducted in the Finnish elderly aged 70+ years and those aged 16-69 years with medical conditions predisposing to severe Covid-19 (chronically ill). Using Cox regression, VE against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalisation was estimated comparing the hazard in the vaccinated with that in the unvaccinated.RESULTS: The cohorts included 901092 elderly (89% vaccinated) and 774526 chronically ill (69% vaccinated) individuals. Three weeks after the first dose, mRNA VE against infection was 45% (95% confidence interval, 36-53%) and 40% (26-51%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalisation was 63% (49-74%) and 82% (56-93%). In chronically ill, AdV VE was 42% (32-50) and 62% (42-75%) against infection and hospitalisation, respectively. One week after the second dose, mRNA VE against infection was 75% (65-82%) and 77% (65-85%) in elderly and chronically ill; mRNA VE against hospitalisation was 93% (70-98%) and 90% (29-99%).CONCLUSIONS: Covid-19 vaccines protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and Covid-19 hospitalisation.

RBD fused to a fluorescent reporter protein accumulates as an intact protein when targeted for ER-Golgi retention or secreted from the cell, while a chloroplast localized version is truncated. The ER-retained RBD fusion protein was able to bind the human ACE2 receptor, the host target of SARS-CoV-2, and was specifically out-competed by mammalian cell-produced recombinant RBD, suggesting that the algae produced proteins are sufficiently post-translationally modified to act as authentic SARS-CoV-2 antigens.

Despite evidence of the effectiveness of government-mandated restrictions mitigating the spread of contagion, these orders are stigmatized due to undesirable economic consequences. This tradeoff resulted in state governments employing mandates at widely different ways. We compare the different policies states implemented during periods of restriction (\"lockdown\") and reopening with indicators of COVID-19 spread and consumer card spending at each state during the first \"wave\" of the pandemic in the U.S. between March and August 2020. We find that while some states enacted reopening decisions when the incidence rate of COVID-19 was minimal or sustained in its relative decline, other states relaxed socioeconomic restrictions near their highest incidence and prevalence rates experienced so far. Nevertheless, all states experienced similar trends in consumer card spending recovery, which was strongly correlated with reopening policies following the lockdowns and relatively independent from COVID-19 incidence rates at the time. Our findings suggest that consumer card spending patterns can be attributed to government mandates rather than COVID-19 incidence in the states. We estimate the recovery in states that reopened in late April was more than the recovery in states that did not reopen in the same period- 15% for consumer card spending and 18% for spending by high income households. This result highlights the important role of state policies in minimizing health impacts while promoting economic recovery and helps planning effective interventions in subsequent waves and immunization efforts.",

The goal of this study was to assess the performance of nanopore-based Sequence-Independent Single Primer Amplification (SISPA) for the detection and characterization of SARS-CoV-2.METHODS: We performed mNGS on clinical samples and designed a diagnostic classifier that corrects for barcode crosstalk between specimens. Phylogenetic analysis was performed on genome assemblies.RESULTS: Our assay yielded 100% specificity overall and 95.2% sensitivity for specimens with a RT-PCR cycle threshold value less than 30. We assembled 10 complete, and one near-complete genomes from 20 specimens that were classified as positive by mNGS. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that 10/11 specimens from British Columbia had a closest relative to another British Columbian specimen. We found 100% concordance between phylogenetic lineage assignment and Variant of Concern (VOC) PCR results. Our assay was able to distinguish between the Alpha and Gamma variants, which was not possible with the current standard VOC PCR being used in British Columbia.CONCLUSIONS: This study supports future work examining the broader feasibility of nanopore mNGS as a diagnostic strategy for the detection and characterization of viral pathogens.",

However, the process of tracing can prove feckless for highly-contagious viruses such as SARS-CoV-2. The interview-based approaches often miss contacts and involve significant delays, while digital solutions can suffer from insufficient adoption rates or inadequate usage patterns. Here we present a novel way of modelling different contact tracing strategies, using a generalized multi-site mean-field model, which can naturally assess the impact of manual and digital approaches alike. Our methodology can readily be applied to any compartmental formulation, thus enabling the study of more complex pathogen dynamics. We use this technique to simulate a newly-defined epidemiological model, SEIR-T, and show that, given the right conditions, tracing in a COVID-19 epidemic can be effective even when digital uptakes are sub-optimal or interviewers miss a fair proportion of the contacts.",

Leveraging a repeated-measures cross-sectional design, we examined the performance of 1517 participants, collected during the early phase of the pandemic in the US (April-June 2020), finding that self-reported pandemic-related worry predicted deficits in information processing speed and maintenance of goal-related contextual information. In a classic economic risk-taking task, we observed that worried individuals' choices were more sensitive to the described outcome probabilities of risky actions. Overall, these results elucidate the cognitive consequences of a large-scale, unpredictable, and uncontrollable stressor, which may in turn play an important role in individuals' understanding of, and adherence to safety directives both in the current crisis and future public health emergencies.",

However, for low-and middle-income countries such as Pakistan, the management protocols for controlling a pandemic are not always as definitive as they would be in other developed nations. Given the dire socio-economic conditions of Sindh, continuation of province-wise lockdowns may inadvertently cause a potential economic breakdown. By using a data driven SEIR modelling framework, this paper describes the evolution of the epidemic projections because of government control measures. The data from reported COVID-19 prevalence and google mobility is used to parameterize the model at different time points. These time points correspond to the government's call for advice on the prerequisite actions required to curtail the spread of COVID-19 in Sindh. Our model predicted the epidemic peak to occur by 18th June 2020 with approximately 3500 reported cases at that peak, this projection correlated with the actual recorded peak during the first wave of the disease in Sindh. The impact of the governmental control actions and religious ceremonies on the epidemic profile during this first wave of COVID-19 are clearly reflected in the model outcomes through variations in the epidemic peaks. We also report these variations by displaying the trajectory of the epidemics had the control measures been guided differently; the epidemic peak may have occurred as early as the end of May 2020 with approximately 5000 reported cases per day had there been no control measures and as late as August 2020 with only around 2000 cases at the peak had the lockdown continued, nearly flattening the epidemic curve.",

The receptor binding motif (RBM), located within the S1 subunit of the spike protein, incorporates the majority of known ACE2 contact residues responsible for high affinity binding and associated virulence. Observation of existing crystal structures of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (SRBD)-ACE2 interface, combined with peptide array screening, allowed us to define a series of linear native RBM-derived peptides that were selected as potential antiviral decoy sequences with the aim of directly binding ACE2 and attenuating viral cell entry. RBM1 (16mer): S443KVGGNYNYLYRLFRK458, RBM2A (25mer): E484GFNCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGYQPY508, RBM2B (20mer): F456NCYFPLQSYGFQPTNGVGY505 and RBM2A-Sc (25mer): NYGLQGSPFGYQETPYPFCNFVQYG. Data from fluorescence polarisation experiments suggested direct binding between RBM peptides and ACE2, with binding affinities ranging from the high nM to low �M range (Kd = 0.207-1.206 �M). However, the RBM peptides demonstrated only modest effects in preventing SRBD internalisation and showed no antiviral activity in a spike protein trimer neutralisation assay. The RBM peptides also failed to suppress S1-protein mediated inflammation in an endogenously expressing ACE2 human cell line. We conclude that linear native RBM-derived peptides are unable to outcompete viral spike protein for binding to ACE2 and therefore represent a suboptimal approach to inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 viral cell entry. These findings reinforce the notion that larger biologics (such as soluble ACE2, 'miniproteins', nanobodies and antibodies) are likely better suited as SARS-CoV-2 cell-entry inhibitors than short-sequence linear peptides.",

Compliance with preventive practices is the single most effective method to overcome the disease. Although several studies have been conducted regarding COVID-19, data on healthcare provider's adherence to COVID-19 preventive practices during childbirth through direct observation is limited. Therefore, this study aimed to assess healthcare provider's adherence to COVID-19 preventive practices during childbirth in northwest Ethiopia.METHODS: A multicenter study was conducted at hospitals in northwest Ethiopia among 406 healthcare providers from November 15 /2020 to March 10 /2021. A simple random sampling technique was employed to select the study subjects. Data were collected via face-to-face interviews and direct observation using a structured questionnaire and standardized checklist respectively. EPI INFO version 7.1.2 and SPSS 25 were used for data entry and analysis respectively. Binary logistic regression analyses were undertaken to identify associated factors. The level of significance was decided based on the adjusted odds ratio (AOR) with a 95% confidence interval at a p-value of ? 0.05.RESULTS: The proportion of healthcare providers having good adherence to COVID-19 preventive practices during intrapartum care was 46.1% (95% CI: 41.2, 50.9). Healthcare providers who had job satisfaction (AOR = 3.18; 95% CI: 1.64, 6.13), had smartphone and/or computer (AOR = 2.75; 95% CI: 1.62, 4.65), ever received training on infection prevention (AOR = 3.58; 95% CI: 2.20, 5.84), earned higher monthly income (AOR = 2.15; 95% CI: 1.30, 3.57), and worked at health facility in the urban area (AOR = 1.72; 95% CI: 1.07, 2.77) had a significant association with adherence to COVID-19 preventive practices. Moreover, the most commonly mentioned barriers for not adhering to the preventive practice of COVID-19 were crowdedness of the delivery room, non-availability of personal protective equipment, and shortage of alcohol or sanitizer.CONCLUSION: The healthcare provider's adherence to COVID-19 preventive practices was low. Hence, stakeholders need to pay special attention to increase healthcare provides' job satisfaction. In addition, the provision of continuous training on infection prevention would be helpful. Furthermore, personal protective equipment, alcohol, and sanitizer supply must be provided for healthcare providers.",

NC health systems faced intense strain to support surging intensive care unit admissions and avert hospital capacity and resource saturation. Forecasting techniques can be used to provide public health decision makers with reliable data needed to better prepare for and respond to public health crises. Hospitalization forecasts in particular play an important role in informing pandemic planning and resource allocation. These forecasts are only relevant, however, when they are accurate, made available quickly, and updated frequently. To support the pressing need for reliable COVID-19 data, RTI adapted a previously developed geospatially explicit healthcare facility network model to predict COVID-19's impact on healthcare resources and capacity in NC. The model adaptation was an iterative process requiring constant evolution to meet stakeholder needs and inform epidemic progression in NC.

Evolutionary analyses assessing whether coronaviruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 infected ancestral species of modern-day animal hosts could be useful in identifying additional reservoirs of potentially dangerous coronaviruses. We reasoned that if a clade of species has been repeatedly exposed to a virus, then their proteins relevant for viral entry may exhibit adaptations that affect host susceptibility or response. We perform comparative analyses across the mammalian phylogeny of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor for SARS-CoV-2, in order to uncover evidence for selection acting at its binding interface with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. We uncover that in rodents there is evidence for adaptive amino acid substitutions at positions comprising the ACE2-spike interaction interface, whereas the variation within ACE2 proteins in primates and some other mammalian clades is not consistent with evolutionary adaptations. We also analyze aminopeptidase N (APN), the receptor for the human coronavirus 229E, a virus that causes the common cold, and find evidence for adaptation in primates. Altogether, our results suggest that the rodent and primate lineages may have had ancient exposures to viruses similar to SARS-CoV-2 and HCoV-229E, respectively.",

The purpose of this article is to report on how the National Council of State Boards of Nursing convened nurse leaders from around the country to explore this problem and develop possible solutions.Coming together virtually, these leaders recommended a national model, the practice-academic partnership, to provide nursing students with in-person clinical experiences during the pandemic. This model is unique in its recognition of the important role of nursing regulatory bodies in these partnerships. The practice-academic partnership model creates clinical education opportunities for students during a public health crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, the model could be applied to meet the chronic challenges nursing education programs have often faced in securing clinical sites, even in the absence of a global or national public health emergency. We provide the context in which the practice-academic partnership model was developed, along with keys to its successful implementation and suggestions for its evaluation. We also discuss the implications of using this model once the pandemic ends.",

Resource limitations, such as available hospital space, staffing, and supplies led some facilities to adopt crisis standards of care, the most extreme operating condition for hospitals, in which the focus of medical decision-making shifted from achieving the best outcomes for individual patients to addressing the immediate care needs of larger groups of patients (3). When hospitals deviated from conventional standards of care, many preventive and elective procedures were suspended, leading to the progression of serious conditions among some persons who would have benefitted from earlier diagnosis and intervention (4). During March-May 2020, U.S. emergency department visits declined by 23% for heart attacks, 20% for strokes, and 10% for diabetic emergencies (5). The Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) COVID Task Force* examined the relationship between hospital strain and excess deaths during July 4, 2020-July 10, 2021, to assess the impact of COVID-19 surges on hospital system operations and potential effects on other critical infrastructure sectors and national critical functions. The study period included the months during which the highly transmissible SARS-CoV-2 B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant became predominant in the United States.† The negative binomial regression model used to calculate estimated deaths predicted that, if intensive care unit (ICU) bed use nationwide reached 75% capacity an estimated 12,000 additional excess deaths would occur nationally over the next 2 weeks. As hospitals exceed 100% ICU bed capacity, 80,000 excess deaths would be expected in the following 2 weeks. This analysis indicates the importance of controlling case growth and subsequent hospitalizations before severe strain. State, local, tribal, and territorial leaders could evaluate ways to reduce strain on public health and health care infrastructures, including implementing interventions to reduce overall disease prevalence such as vaccination and other prevention strategies, as well as ways to expand or enhance capacity during times of high disease prevalence.",

Although there are benefits to caregiving, it can negatively affect caregivers' physical and mental health (2-4). Much of the assistance caregivers provide, such as administering medications or financial management, relies on cognitive ability, but little is known about caregivers' cognitive functioning. Subjective cognitive decline (SCD), the self-reported experience of worsening or more frequent confusion or memory loss over the past year (5), could affect caregivers' risk for adverse health outcomes and affect the quality of care they provide. CDC analyzed SCD among caregivers aged ?45 years through a cross-sectional analysis of data from 22 states in the 2015-2019 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS). Among adults aged ?45 years, SCD was reported by 12.6% of caregivers who provided care to a family member or friend with a health condition or disability in the past 30 days compared with 10.2% of noncaregivers (p<0.001). Caregivers with SCD were more likely to be employed, men, aged 45-64 years, and have chronic health conditions than were noncaregivers with SCD. Caregivers with SCD were more likely to report frequent mental distress, a history of depression, and frequent activity limitations than were caregivers without SCD. SCD among caregivers could adversely affect the quality of care provided to care recipients. Understanding caregivers' cognitive health and the types of care provided is critical to maintaining the health, well-being, and independence of the caregiving dyad. Health care professionals can support patients and their patients' caregivers by increasing awareness among caregivers of the need to monitor their own health. The health care team can work with caregivers to identify potential treatments and access supports that might help them in their caregiving role and compensate for SCD.",

Among members aged ?12 years of a large integrated health care delivery system in Oregon and Washington, incidence of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, emergency department (ED) visits, and hospitalizations were calculated by COVID-19 vaccination status, vaccine product, age, race, and ethnicity. Infection after full vaccination was defined as a positive SARS-CoV-2 molecular test result ?14 days after completion of an authorized COVID-19 vaccination series.* During the July-September 2021 surveillance period, SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred among 4,146 of 137,616 unvaccinated persons (30.1 per 1,000 persons) and 3,009 of 344,848 fully vaccinated persons (8.7 per 1,000). Incidence was higher among unvaccinated persons than among vaccinated persons across all demographic strata. Unvaccinated persons with SARS-CoV-2 infection were more than twice as likely to receive ED care (18.5%) or to be hospitalized (9.0%) than were vaccinated persons with COVID-19 (8.1% and 3.9%, respectively). The crude mortality rate was also higher among unvaccinated patients (0.43 per 1,000) than in fully vaccinated patients (0.06 per 1,000). These data support CDC recommendations for COVID-19 vaccination, including additional and booster doses, to protect individual persons and communities against COVID-19, including illness and hospitalization caused by the Delta variant (1).",

Subsequently, a noninvasive alternative to optical colonoscopy (OC) would be welcomed. One such technology is capsule endoscopy, including the PillCam COLON 2 (PCC2), though research validating its use in ileocolonic CD is limited. This study aims to compare PCC2 with ileocolonoscopy (OC) in assessing mucosal CD through use of a standardized scoring system.METHODS: At an Australian tertiary hospital, same-day PCC2 and ileocolonoscopy results of 47 CD patients, with known nonstricturing disease, were prospectively collected and analyzed for correlation and agreement. Deidentified recordings were reported by a single expert gastroenterologist. Mucosal disease was quantified using the Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's Disease (SES-CD). The SES-CD results of paired endoscopic modalities were compared in total per bowel segment and per SES-CD variable.RESULTS: Of 47 PCC2 recordings, 68% were complete, fully assessing terminal ileum to rectum, and OC was complete in 89%. Correlation (r) between total SES-CD scores was strongest in the terminal ileum (r = 0.77, P < .001), with the SES-CD variable of \"ulcer detection\" showing the strongest agreement. The PCC2 (vs OC) identified additional ulcers in the terminal ileum; ascending, transverse, and descending colon; and rectum; scores were 5 (1), 5 (3), 1 (1), 2 (1), and 2 (2), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The PCC2 shows promise in assessing ileocolonic mucosa, especially in proximal bowel segments, with greater reach of visualization in the small bowel. Given the resource and safety considerations raised by the Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, capsule endoscopy has particular significance.This article aims to contribute to the limited body of research surrounding the validity of capsule endoscopy technology in assessing ileocolonic mucosa in Crohn's Disease patients. In doing so, an alternative option for patients enduring frequent endoscopies is given potential.",

The analysis of the XANES region of the measured spectra shows that Zn binds to BST2, as well as to orf7a, thus resulting in the formation of BST2-orf7a complexes. This structural information confirms the the conjecture, recently put forward by some of the present Authors, according to which the accessory orf7a (and possibly also orf8) viral protein are capable of interfering with the BST2 antiviral activity. Our explanation for this behavior is that, when BST2 gets in contact with Zn bound to the orf7a Cys15 ligand, it has the ability of displacing the metal owing to the creation of a new disulfide bridge across the two proteins. The formation of this BST2-orf7a complex destabilizes BST2 dimerization, thus impairing the antiviral activity of the latter.",

However, children and paediatric intensive care units (PICUs) were affected indirectly. We analysed the impact of the pandemic on PICU admission patterns and patient characteristics in the UK and Ireland.METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all admissions to PICUs in children < 18�years during Jan-Dec 2020, using data collected from 32 PICUs via a central database (PICANet). Admission patterns, case-mix, resource use, and outcomes were compared with the four preceding years (2016-2019) based on the date of admission.RESULTS: There were 16,941 admissions in 2020 compared to an annual average of 20,643 (range 20,340-20,868) from 2016 to 2019. During 2020, there was a reduction in all PICU admissions (18%), unplanned admissions (20%), planned admissions (15%), and bed days (25%). There was a 41% reduction in respiratory admissions, and a 60% reduction in children admitted with bronchiolitis but an 84% increase in admissions for diabetic ketoacidosis during 2020 compared to the previous years. There were 420 admissions (2.4%) with either PIMS-TS or COVID-19 during 2020. Age and sex adjusted prevalence of unplanned PICU admission reduced from 79.7 (2016-2019) to 63.1 per 100,000 in 2020. Median probability of death [1.2 (0.5-3.4) vs. 1.2 (0.5-3.4) %], length of stay [2.3 (1.0-5.5) vs. 2.4 (1.0-5.7) days] and mortality rates [3.4 vs. 3.6%, (risk-adjusted OR 1.00 [0.91-1.11, p = 0.93])] were similar between 2016-2019 and 2020. There were 106 fewer in-PICU deaths in 2020 (n = 605) compared with 2016-2019 (n = 711).CONCLUSIONS: The use of a high-quality international database allowed robust comparisons between admission data prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic. A significant reduction in prevalence of unplanned admissions, respiratory diseases, and fewer child deaths in PICU observed may be related to the targeted COVID-19 public health interventions during the pandemic. However, analysis of wider and longer-term societal impact of the pandemic and public health interventions on physical and mental health of children is required.",

Secondary outcomes included SARS-CoV-2 transmission and covid-19 mortality.DATA SYNTHESIS: DerSimonian Laird random effects meta-analysis was performed to investigate the effect of mask wearing, handwashing, and physical distancing measures on incidence of covid-19. Pooled effect estimates with corresponding 95% confidence intervals were computed, and heterogeneity among studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test and the I2 metrics, with two tailed P values.RESULTS: 72 studies met the inclusion criteria, of which 35 evaluated individual public health measures and 37 assessed multiple public health measures as a \"package of interventions.\" Eight of 35 studies were included in the meta-analysis, which indicated a reduction in incidence of covid-19 associated with handwashing (relative risk 0.47, 95% confidence interval 0.19 to 1.12, I2=12%), mask wearing (0.47, 0.29 to 0.75, I2=84%), and physical distancing (0.75, 0.59 to 0.95, I2=87%). Owing to heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis was not possible for the outcomes of quarantine and isolation, universal lockdowns, and closures of borders, schools, and workplaces. The effects of these interventions were synthesised descriptively.CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review and meta-analysis suggests that several personal protective and social measures, including handwashing, mask wearing, and physical distancing are associated with reductions in the incidence covid-19. Public health efforts to implement public health measures should consider community health and sociocultural needs, and future research is needed to better understand the effectiveness of public health measures in the context of covid-19 vaccination.SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: PROSPERO CRD42020178692.",

The distributed lag non-linear model was used to determine the optimal absolute humidity of death and discuss their non-linear lagged effects. Attributable fraction and population attributable mortality were calculated based on the optimal absolute humidity, defined as the minimum mortality absolute humidity.RESULTS: The association between absolute humidity and total respiratory disease mortality showed an M-shaped non-linear curve. In total, 21.57% (95% CI 14.20 ~ 27.75%) of respiratory disease mortality (9154 deaths) was attributable to non-optimum absolute humidity. The attributable fractions due to high absolute humidity were 13.49% (95% CI 9.56 ~ 16.98%), while mortality burden of low absolute humidity were 8.08% (95% CI 0.89 ~ 13.93%), respectively. Extreme dry and moist absolute humidity accounted for total respiratory disease mortality fraction of 0.87% (95% CI - 0.09 ~ 1.58%) and 0.91% (95% CI 0.25 ~ 1.39%), respectively. There was no significant gender and age difference in the burden of attributable risk due to absolute humidity.CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed that both high and low absolute humidity are responsible for considerable respiratory disease mortality burden, the component attributed to the high absolute humidity effect is greater. Our results may have important implications for the development of public health measures to reduce respiratory disease mortality.",

After seeking their consent, we included 303 patients aged ? 18 years and hemodialysis for ? 3 months. Clinical symptoms and biological parameters were collected from medical records. Patients' blood samples were tested with Abbott SARS-CoV-2 Ig G assay using an Architect system. Statistical tests were performed with STATA 12.0.RESULTS: Seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was 21.1% (95% CI = 16.7-26.1%). We noticed a wide variability in SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence between regions ranging from 5.6 to 51.7%. Among the 38 patients who underwent nasal swab testing, only six had a PCR-confirmed infection and all of them did seroconvert. Suggestive clinical symptoms were reported by 28.1% of seropositive patients and the majority of them presented asymptomatic disease. After multivariate analysis, a previous contact with a confirmed case and living in a high population density region were associated with the presence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.CONCLUSION: This study presents to our knowledge the first seroprevalence data in African hemodialysis patients.

Thematic analysis was undertaken to identify both similar and contrasting experiences and perspectives in relation to topics of interest. Data analysis also sought to identify any trends indicating differences between ethnic groups.RESULTS: Limited awareness of the role nutrition has in cancer recovery or prevention, combined with little or no access to nutrition advice/support, meant that healthy dietary change was not a focus for some cancer survivors in this study, whereas others invested considerable time and money accessing nutrition information and support outside of cancer care services. Financial limitations (eg, cost of healthy food and low income) and lack of practical support were also important barriers to post-diagnosis healthy eating.CONCLUSION: There is a need for more widely available cancer-specific nutrition advice and support in New Zealand. Interventions to address financial barriers and increase access to cancer-related nutrition advice and support have the potential to improve cancer outcomes and reduce inequities in cancer outcomes.",

These patients were identified from the National Breast Cancer Register or the New Zealand Cancer Registry and linked with the Pharmaceutical Collection, National Minimum Dataset, National Non-Admitted Patient Collection and Mortality Collection.RESULTS: 22,948 breast cancer patients were included. The mean public health cost of breast cancer was NZ$44,954 per patient for the period of three months preceding and five years following cancer diagnosis, with the treatment phase accounting for 70% of the cost and the follow-up phase accounting for the remaining 30%. During the treatment phase, surgery costs accounted for the biggest proportion (35%) of the total cost, followed by immunotherapy costs (18%), radiotherapy costs (17%) and costs of diagnostic test, scan and biopsy (16%). The costs decreased substantially with age, from $69,121 for women younger than 45 years old to $23,805 for those aged 80 or over.CONCLUSIONS: The costs of breast cancer in New Zealand's public health system are substantial and have been increasing. However, outcomes of breast cancer have been improving. The results of this study can be used as a baseline of actual costs for comparing the costs of introducing new diagnosis and treatment modalities in the future.",

Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate adjusted hazard ratio of breast cancer-specific mortality by treatments.RESULTS: The adjusted odds ratio of having chemotherapy and trastuzumab (for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 positive (HER2+) disease) for Pacific women was 0.43 and 0.13 compared to European women. Patients receiving chemotherapy had improved survival for HER2+ non-luminal and triple negative metastatic breast cancer (MBC) (hazard ratios: 0.30, 0.66).

Secondary outcomes explored the association between re-operation rate for surgical failures, ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation.METHOD: Cases receiving operative management for strabismus were retrieved from the National Minimum Dataset. The incidence of surgery was correlated to patient demographics by ethnicity and socioeconomic deprivation and compared to population profiles for 0-19-year-olds constructed from the 2013 census.RESULTS: There were 4,476 strabismus surgeries recorded over a 10 year period from 1 January 2005 to 31 December 2014 included in the study. There was a lower incidence of strabismus surgery performed in M?ori, Pacific Peoples and the least socioeconomically deprived cohort. There were significant inter-regional variations in the incidence of strabismus surgery. The European ethnic group was 1.4 times as likely to receive subsequent procedures following a primary procedure than either M?ori or Pacific Peoples.CONCLUSION: Disproportionately fewer strabismus surgeries were performed in M?ori, Pacific Peoples and New Zealanders from the lowest deprived group in the New Zealand Public Health System. Minority ethnic groups are less likely to receive secondary operations following a primary procedure when compared to a European cohort. Further research is needed to directly compare health outcomes between these high-needs and lower-needs groups.",

The distance scores were then grouped into ten distance deciles (DDs).RESULTS: When these DDs are compared with Stats NZ's urban-rural indicator, \"small urban areas\" fall mainly along with rural and remote areas into the two DDs (DD9 and DD10) based on the greatest distance scores. When compared with Stats NZ's urban accessibility classification, the same two DDs correspond mainly to the most rural and remote areas. In both the North and South islands, 25% or more of enrollees in DD9 and DD10 are aged 60+.

We aimed to measure change in symptoms related specifically to oesophageal cancer and overall QOL before and 30 days after stent insertion, to measure adverse effects and to define any patient factors that may be significant in predicting patients who may benefit most.METHODS: We prospectively enrolled patients in an observational study at Middlemore Hospital, New Zealand, and administered validated QOL- and symptomatology-based questionnaires before and 30 days after stent insertion. Additional patient-related demographics, procedural characteristics, adverse events and outcomes were collected.RESULTS: Between 31 March 2014 and 3 July 2020, 57 patients were initially recruited. Four patients withdrew from the study, and 13 patients died before 30 days. Forty patients (29 males; mean�SD age, 72�12 years) completed the study. A significant improvement was noted at one-month post stent insertion in the overall global QOL score (mean 35 to 46, p=0.01). The most significant score improvements were seen in dysphagia, trouble eating, trouble swallowing saliva and dry mouth (p<0.001). Physical, emotional, cognitive and social functioning did not change. Post-procedural adverse events occurred in 17 patients (43%). A poorer initial level of functioning was associated with reduced improvement in global QOL (p?0.04). Patients followed-up died a mean of 2.8 months after insertion.CONCLUSION: In patients surviving longer than 30 days, there is significant improvement of overall QOL and dysphagia one-month post oesophageal stent insertion for malignant, palliative dysphagia. Multiple psychosocial facets were unchanged with this intervention. Stent-related adverse events were common.",

Approximately 3% of people of European ancestry are likely to have a partial deficiency in this enzyme. These individuals are typically asymptomatic until exposed to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) or capecitabine (which forms 5-FU) for treatment of gastrointestinal or breast cancer. These individuals are then at considerably increased risk of severe to life-threatening adverse events. There are four well established risk variants within the DPYD gene that encodes dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase. Although consensus guidelines for genotype-guided dosing of 5-FU and capecitabine have existed for a number of years, the implementation of this type of personalised medicine has not been widely adopted. This viewpoint covers the current state of knowledge about both genotype and phenotype testing, as well as the reported cost-savings and clinical effectiveness of pre-screening patients followed by dose-adjustment. Recent recommendations by agencies and professional societies, both in Europe and the USA, highlight the need for New Zealand oncologists to begin an informed discussion about whether it is now an appropriate time to advocate for routine access to testing for this enzyme deficiency in New Zealand cancer patients.",

Using data from national phone surveys implemented in Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria and Uganda during the pandemic and the pre-COVID-19 national face-to-face surveys that served as the sampling frames for the phone surveys, this paper documents selection the biases in individual-level analyses based on phone survey data. In most cases, individual-level data are available only for phone survey respondents, who we find are more likely to be household heads or their spouses and non-farm enterprise owners, and on average, are older and better educated vis-a-vis the general adult population. These differences are the result of uneven access to mobile phones in the population and the way that phone survey respondents are selected. To improve the representativeness of individual-level analysis using phone survey data, we recalibrate the phone survey sampling weights based on propensity score adjustments that are derived from a model of an individual's likelihood of being interviewed as a function of individual- and household-level attributes. We find that reweighting improves the representativeness of the estimates for phone survey respondents, moving them closer to those of the general adult population. This holds for both women and men and for a range of demographic, education, and labor market outcomes. However, reweighting increases the variance of the estimates and, in most cases, fails to overcome selection biases. This indicates limitations to deriving representative individual-level estimates from phone survey data. Obtaining reliable data on men and women through future phone surveys will require random selection of adult interviewees within sampled households.",

Their trust in the information, understanding, feelings of effectiveness of eye protection, and the likelihood of them adopting it were measured.FINDINGS: Compared to those given no quality cues, participants who were told the quality of the evidence on eye protection was 'low', rated the evidence less trustworthy (p = .001, d = 0.25), and rated it as subjectively less effective (p = .018, d = 0.19). The same effects emerged compared to those who were told the quality of the evidence was 'high', and in one of the two studies, those shown 'low' quality of evidence said they were less likely to use eye protection (p = .005, d = 0.18). Participants who were told the quality of the evidence was 'high' showed no statistically significant differences on these measures compared to those given no information about evidence quality.CONCLUSIONS: Without quality of evidence cues, participants responded to the evidence about the public health intervention as if it was high quality and this affected their subjective perceptions of its efficacy and trust in the provided information. This raises the ethical dilemma of weighing the importance of transparently stating when the evidence base is actually low quality against evidence that providing such information can decrease trust, perception of intervention efficacy, and likelihood of adopting it.",

This study aimed to identify the determinants of COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy based on the World Health Organization's '3Cs' model (i.e., confidence, complacency, and convenience) in the United States (U.S.) and Canada.METHODS: Data from 7678 adults ages 18 or older were collected from the four most populous U.S. States, specifically New York, California, Florida, and Texas, and from English-speaking Canada at three timepoints, in May and July 2020, and March 2021 using a web-based survey (www.covid19-database.com). Sociodemographic information was collected, and comprehensive psychological assessments were administered. Univariate analyses were performed to identify the individual determinants of vaccine hesitancy, which were categorized as: 1) vaccine confidence, 2) vaccine complacency, 3) sociodemographic, and 4) other psychological factors. A series of models were computed using these categorizations.RESULTS: Mistrust of vaccine benefit (�(SE) = 0.67(0.01), p<0.001, partial �2 = 0.26) and lower perceived seriousness of COVID-19 (�(SE) = 0.68(0.02), p<0.001, partial �2 = 0.12) were the principal determinants of vaccine hesitancy. Right-wing political affiliation (�(SE) = 0.32(0.02), p<0.001, partial �2 = 0.03), higher risk propensity (�(SE) = 0.24(0.02), p<0.001, partial �2 = 0.03), and less negative mental health effects of the COVID-19 pandemic (�(SE) = 0.20(0.01), p<0.001, partial �2 = 0.03) were the main sociodemographic and psychological determinants. Other sociodemographic determinants included younger age, women, race, and employment status. Lack of vaccine confidence and complacency explained 38% and 21% of the variance in vaccine hesitancy, respectively; whereas, sociodemographic and psychological determinants explained 13% and 11% of the variance in vaccine hesitancy, respectively.DISCUSSION: Targeted and tailored public health interventions that enhance the public's confidence in vaccines and emphasize the risk and seriousness of COVID-19 may address COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy.

When considered by COVID-19 disease severity, there was a trend toward increased prevalence of AT1R-Ab (55% vs. 31%, p = 0.07), as well as significantly higher AT1R-Ab levels (median 10.7 vs. 5.9 U/mL, p = 0.03) amongst individuals with mild COVID-19 versus matched controls. In contrast, the prevalence (42% vs. 37%, p = 0.9) and level (both medians 6.7 U/mL, p = 0.9) of AT1R-Ab amongst those with severe COVID-19 did not differ from matched controls.CONCLUSIONS: These findings support an association between COVID-19 and AT1R-Ab, emphasizing that vascular pathology may be present in individuals with mild COVID-19 as well as those with severe disease.",

Despite mass progress in COVID-19 vaccination uptake, vaccine hesitancy or anti-vax information has been reported that can delay public acceptance of a vaccine. An online cross-sectional survey (n = 439) assessed COVID-19 vaccine uptake and hesitancy in adults in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Participants completed an adapted version of the Theory of Planned Behaviour Vaccine Questionnaire, the Vaccine Attitudes Scale (VAX), Vaccine Confidence Scale, and questions on previous experience of COVID-19. Results showed that 66.7% of the sample intended to get a vaccination as soon as possible, 27.15% reported they will get a vaccine when others get theirs and when it is clear there are no side effects. 6.15% had no intention of getting a vaccine. Overall, there is a high mean intention (M = 6.12) and confidence to get a COVID-19 vaccine. There was low vaccine hesitancy (M = 2.49) as measured by the VAX scale. A further analysis of the sub factors of the VAX showed there is uncertainty and mistrust of side effects for children. The finding demonstrate that the Theory of Planned Behaviour can be useful in making recommendations for public health considerations when encouraging vaccine uptake and reducing vaccine hesitancy.",

While school reopening seems critical for the education and mental health of children, adolescents, and adults, so far the literature has not systematically reached a consensus whether to recommend the return to schools in a way that would be safe for students and staff.OBJECTIVE: To synthesize and critically evaluate the scientific evidence on the potential risk of accelerating the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic among children, adolescents, young adults, and adults with school reopening.METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis protocol was elaborated following the PRISMA-P. We will include all observational study designs, which report on the potential risk of accelerating the COVID-2019 pandemic with school reopening. Electronic databases included were MEDLINE/PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, SCOPUS and CNKI. Additional sources will be also retrieved, including Clinical trials.gov-NIH, The British Library, Pro Quest Dissertations Database, Public Health Gray Literature Sources and Health Evidence, Google Scholar, and pre-prints [medRXiv]. No restriction to language or date will be used as search strategy. In an independently manner, two investigators will select studies, perform data extraction, as well as perform a critical appraisal of the risk of bias and overall quality of the selected observational studies, based on their designs. The heterogeneity among the studies will be assessed using the I2 statistic test. According to the results of this test, we will verify whether a meta-analysis is feasible. If feasibility is confirmed, a random-effect model analysis will be carried out. For data analysis, the calculation of the pooled effect estimates will consider a 95% CI and alpha will be set in 0.05 using the R statistical software, v.4.0.4. In addition, we will rate the certainty of evidence based on Cochrane methods and in accordance with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE).EXPECTED RESULTS: This systematic review and meta-analysis will provide better insights into safety in the return to school in the context of the COVID-2019 pandemic, at a time when vaccination advances unevenly in several countries around the world. Hence, consistent data and robust evidence will be provided to help decision-makers and stakeholders in the current pandemic scenario.PROSPERO REGISTRATION NUMBER: CRD42021265283; https://clinicaltrials.gov.",

This study evaluates the performance of the CDC vaccine allocation strategy with respect to multiple potentially competing vaccination goals (minimizing mortality, cases, infections, and years of life lost (YLL)), under the same framework as the CDC allocation: four priority vaccination groups and population demographics stratified by age, comorbidities, occupation and living condition (congested or non-congested).METHODS AND FINDINGS: We developed a compartmental disease model that incorporates key elements of the current pandemic including age-varying susceptibility to infection, age-varying clinical fraction, an active case-count dependent social distancing level, and time-varying infectivity (accounting for the emergence of more infectious virus strains). The CDC allocation strategy is compared to all other possibly optimal allocations that stagger vaccine roll-out in up to four phases (17.5 million strategies). The CDC allocation strategy performed well in all vaccination goals but never optimally. Under the developed model, the CDC allocation deviated from the optimal allocations by small amounts, with 0.19% more deaths, 4.0% more cases, 4.07% more infections, and 0.97% higher YLL, than the respective optimal strategies. The CDC decision to not prioritize the vaccination of individuals under the age of 16 was optimal, as was the prioritization of health-care workers and other essential workers over non-essential workers. Finally, a higher prioritization of individuals with comorbidities in all age groups improved outcomes compared to the CDC allocation.CONCLUSION: The developed approach can be used to inform the design of future vaccine allocation strategies in the United States, or adapted for use by other countries seeking to optimize the effectiveness of their vaccine allocation strategies.",

Hospitalization rate ratios (HRRs) comparing the study period with the control period were calculated for 3 intervals (before lockdown [January 1 to March 15], during lockdown [March 16 to May 10], and after lockdown [May 11 to July 31]) and were stratified by gender, age and hospital type.Results: The study included 46 393 patients hospitalized for hip fracture during January to July 2019 (34 589 [74.4%] women; mean [SD] age, 82.8 [10.5] years) and 44 767 patients hospitalized for hip fracture from January to July 2020 (33 160 [74.1%] women; mean [SD] age, 82.9 [10.5] years). During the lockdown in 2020, 10 429 patients (23.30%) were hospitalized for hip fracture compared with 11 782 patients (25.40%) during the same period in 2019 (HRR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.86-0.91; P < .001). The lockdown period was associated with a decrease in the number of hip fractures of 11% among women (from 8756 in 2019 to 7788 in 2020) and 13% among men (from 3026 in 2019 to 2641 in 2020). When the absolute number of hip fractures was stratified by age group, the lockdown period was associated with a decrease in the number of hip fractures in all age groups except in patients older than 89 years (HRR, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.92-1.01; P = .17). In the group of patients aged 80 to 89 years, the number of hip fractures decreased from 4925 to 4370 (HRR, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.85-0.92; P < .001). During the lockdown, hospitalizations decreased by 33% (HRR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.63-0.71; P < .001) in public university hospitals and by 24% (HRR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73-0.79; P < .001) in public general hospitals but increased by 46% (HRR, 1.46; 95% CI,1.38-1.54; P < .001) in private for-profit hospitals.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, hospitalizations for hip fractures in France decreased by 11% during the first nationwide COVID-19 lockdown. Further studies are needed to investigate the long-lasting consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the incidence of osteoporotic fractures.",

Different countries have since enforced varying levels of lockdowns and guidelines for their populations to follow in a serious effort to mitigate the spread. Up until recently, the majority of these regulations and policies were established on the assumption that the dominant routes of transmission of this virus are through droplets and fomite contact. However, there is now a substantial amount of research pointing towards the strong possibility that SARS-CoV-2 can spread through airborne means. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have recently recognized this, which poses the question of whether our collective methods of lessening transmission risk and keeping people safe have been sufficient. This paper is a comprehensive review of the evidence on SARS-CoV-2 being an airborne disease, through different epidemiological, experimental, and animal-model based published research. Studies opposing this evidence have also been discussed. The majority of these studies are favoring the high plausibility of SARS-CoV-2 aerosol transmission, and therefore the many implications of aerosol transmission have been discussed in this paper to suggest effective mitigation and control strategies.",

Comorbidity features including coronary artery disease, peripheral arterial disease, congestive heart failure, hypertension, atrial fibrillation, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cerebrovascular event, cancer status, and renal disease were recorded. The patients were divided as surviving group (n=440) and non-survivors (n=68).RESULTS: The in-hospital mortality rate of the patients with COVID-19 was 13.4%. Factors found to be associated with mortality in univariate analysis were CHA2DS2-VASc, CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, R2CHA2DS2-VASc, cancer state, atrial fibrillation, hemoglobin, lymphocyte count, CRP, albumin and ferritin. Model 1 multivariate cox regression analysis revealed CHA2DS2-VASc, hemoglobin, CRP and ferritin levels to be independently associated with mortality. Factors that were found to be independently associated with in-hospital mortality in Model 2 analysis were CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, R2CHA2DS2-VASc, hemoglobin, CRP and ferritin whereas except hemoglobin in Model 3 analysis, the other variables had been the same. Predictive power of R2CHA2DS2-VASc was better than of both CHA2DS2-VASc (p=0.002) and CHA2DS2-VASc-HS (p=0.034) in determining the in-hospital mortality. Patients with higher R2CHA2DS2-VASc (> 3 points), CHA2DS2-VASc-HS (> 3 points) and CHA2DS2-VASc (> 2 points) scores exhibited the highest mortality rate in survival analysis by using Kaplan-Meier and long-rank tests.CONCLUSIONS: CHA2DS2-VASc, CHA2DS2-VASc-HS, and R2CHA2DS2-VASc were found to be independent predictors of mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The current study revealed that the predictive ability of R2CHA2DS2-VASc was better than the both of CHA2DS2-VASc and CHA2DS2-VASc-HS score.",

After splitting studies depending on whether serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations were statistically different between patients with poor vs. favorable outcomes, the 35 'hepatic involvement' articles (p<0.05) included 28,510 patients (51% males), 5,279 (66% males) and 23,231 subjects (48% males) with poor and favorable outcomes, respectively. The 63 'extra-hepatic involvement' studies (p>0.05) included 15,044 patients (54% males), 4,704 (60% males) with poor outcomes and 10,340 (51% males) with favorable outcomes.RESULTS: The meta-analysis shows that serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations were significantly higher in patients with poor outcomes than those with favorable outcomes (WMD 12.5 UI/L, 95% CI 10.9 to 14.1 p<0.001). Similarly, AST concentrations were significantly higher in the 'hepatic involvement' studies (WMD 16.3 UI/L, 95% CI 13.4 to 19.2 p<0.001) and in the 'extra-hepatic involvement' studies (WMD 10.3 UI/L, 95% CI 8.6 to 12.0 p<0.001).CONCLUSIONS: The different association of serum AST concentrations with some clinical, demographic, and biochemical factors in the two clusters suggests that in COVID-19 patients, serum AST elevation is not necessarily linked to real liver damage.",

The study made use of online tools due to the impossibility of conventional methods during the COVID-19 lockdown.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pupils received formal training in bCPR. Training was imparted uniformly by a teacher at the school (qualified in Basic Life Support -BLS- and Advanced Life Support -ALS- training by the CPR National Plan). The skills acquired (those proposed as essential for bCPR training by the European Resuscitation Council) were evaluated fifteen weeks later. Skills acquisition was evaluated by means of an online questionnaire developed specifically for the study.RESULTS: In all the cognitive skills included in bCPR training, the acquisition level achieved was over 65%. Acquisition of knowledge of the anatomical areas at which cardiac massage must be applied and the means of emergency systems activation was high, while 25.5% of pupils knew the order in which maneuvers should be performed. Pupils' self-confidence and self-perception of their capacity to act when faced with a real CPR situation increased significantly.CONCLUSIONS: Primary school pupils learned all the cognitive skills involved in bCPR, showing high levels of skills acquisition and positive self-perception of their capacity to apply them.",

Further, we have studied the effectiveness of the inhibitor against HIV-2 protease (PR2). The MM-PBSA calculation suggests that TMC-126 loses its potency against mutant variants and PR2 compared to wild-type PR1 mainly due to the loss in intermolecular electrostatic interactions. The potency of the inhibitor decreases in the order: wild type PR1 >�M46L > MDR20 >�I50V > PR2 >�V32I > A28S. Our study reveals that the flap of PR1 adopts a semi-open conformation due to the mutation I50V or MDR20. The dissimilar nature of the movement of the flap tip of both monomers is evident from the dynamic cross-correlation map. The protein structural network analysis displays that mutation causes structural rearrangements and changes the communication path between residues. Overall, we believe our study may help explore and accelerate the development of novel HIV-1/HIV-2 protease inhibitors with better potency.",

Little is known, however, about specific positive and negative individual and organizational factors that affect the mental health of emergency physicians (EP) during COVID-19. Our objective was to assess these factors in a broad geographic sample of EPs in the United States.METHODS: We conducted an electronic, prospective, cross-sectional national survey of EPs from October 6-December 29, 2020. Measures assessed negative mental health outcomes (depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia), positive work-related outcomes, and strategies used to cope with COVID-19. After preliminary analyses and internal reliability testing, we performed four separate three-stage hierarchical multiple regression analyses to examine individual and organizational predictive factors for psychological distress.RESULTS: Response rate was 50%, with 517 EPs completing the survey from 11 different sites. Overall, 85% of respondents reported negative psychological effects due to COVID-19. Participants reported feeling more stressed (31%), lonelier (26%), more anxious (25%), more irritable (24%) and sadder (17.5%). Prevalence of mental health conditions was 17% for depression, 13% for anxiety, 7.5% for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 18% for insomnia. Regular exercise decreased from 69% to 56%, while daily alcohol use increased from 8% to 15%. Coping strategies of behavioral disengagement, self-blame, and venting were significant predictors of psychological distress, while humor and positive reframing were negatively associated with psychological distress.CONCLUSION: Emergency physicians have experienced high levels of psychological distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. Those using avoidant coping strategies were most likely to experience depression, anxiety, insomnia, and PTSD, while humor and positive reframing were effective coping strategies.",

A screening tool is valuable as the healthcare community balances protection of medical personnel and conservation of PPE. There is little existing literature on the efficacy of prehospital COVID-19 screening tools. The objective of this study was to determine the positive and negative predictive value of an emergency infectious disease surveillance tool for detecting COVID-19 patients and the impact of positive screening on PPE usage.METHODS: This study was a retrospective chart review of prehospital care reports and hospital electronic health records. We abstracted records for all 911 calls to an urban EMS from March 1-July 31, 2020 that had a documented positive screen for COVID-19 and/or had a positive COVID-19 test. The dispatch screen solicited information regarding travel, sick contacts, and high-risk symptoms. We reviewed charts to determine dispatch-screening results, the outcome of patients' COVID-19 testing, and documentation of crew fidelity to PPE guidelines.RESULTS: The sample size was 263. The rate of positive COVID-19 tests for all-comers in the state of Massachusetts was 2.0%. The dispatch screen had a sensitivity of 74.9% (confidence interval [CI], 69.21-80.03) and a specificity of 67.7% (CI, 66.91-68.50). The positive predictive value was 4.5% (CI, 4.17-4.80), and the negative predictive value was 99.3% (CI, 99.09-99.40). The most common symptom that triggered a positive screen was shortness of breath (51.5% of calls). The most common high-risk population identified was skilled nursing facility patients (19.5%), but most positive tests did not belong to a high-risk population (58.1%). The EMS personnel were documented as wearing full PPE for the patient in 55.7% of encounters, not wearing PPE in 8.0% of encounters, and not documented in 27.9% of encounters.CONCLUSION: This dispatch-screening questionnaire has a high negative predictive value but moderate sensitivity and therefore should be used with some caution to guide EMS crews in their PPE usage. Clinical judgment is still essential and may supersede screening status.",

While published research has shown clinical characteristics associated with severe illness from COVID-19, there is limited data focused on the emergency department (ED) discharge population.METHODS: We performed a retrospective chart review of all ED-discharged patients from Wake Forest Baptist Health and Wake Forest Baptist Health Davie Medical Center between April 25-August 9, 2020, who tested positive for severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) from a nasopharyngeal swab using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients who were discharged and had return visits within 30 days to those patients who did not return to the ED within 30 days.RESULTS: Our study included 235 adult patients who had an ED-performed SARS-CoV-2 rRT-PCR positive test and were subsequently discharged on their first ED visit. Of these patients, 57 (24.3%) had return visits to the ED within 30 days for symptoms related to COVID-19. Of these 57 patients, on return ED visits 27 were admitted to the hospital and 30 were not admitted. Of the 235 adult patients who were discharged, 11.5% (27) eventually required admission for COVID-19-related symptoms. With 24.3% patients having a return ED visit after a positive SARS-CoV-2 test and 11.5% requiring eventual admission, it is important to understand clinical characteristics associated with return ED visits. We performed multivariate logistic regression analysis of the clinical characteristics with independent association resulting in a return ED visit, which demonstrated the following: diabetes (odds ratio [OR] 2.990, 95% confidence interval [CI, 1.21-7.40, P = 0.0179); transaminitis (OR 8.973, 95% CI, 2.65-30.33, P = 0.004); increased pulse at triage (OR 1.04, 95% CI, 1.02-1.07, P = 0.0002); and myalgia (OR 4.43, 95% CI, 2.03-9.66, P = 0.0002).CONCLUSION: As EDs across the country continue to treat COVID-19 patients, it is important to understand the clinical factors associated with ED return visits related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. We identified key clinical characteristics associated with return ED visits for patients initially diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection: diabetes mellitus; increased pulse at triage; transaminitis; and complaint of myalgias.",

The cohort included the national population of Medicare patients receiving long-term dialysis in 2020, derived from clinical and administrative databases. COVID-19 was identified through Medicare claims sources. Data were analyzed on May 17, 2021.Main Outcomes and Measures: The 2 main outcomes were COVID-19 and all-cause mortality. Associations of claims-based risk factors with COVID-19 and mortality were investigated prediagnosis and postdiagnosis.Results: Among a total of 498 169 Medicare patients undergoing dialysis (median [IQR] age, 66 [56-74] years; 215 935 [43.1%] women and 283 227 [56.9%] men), 60 090 (12.1%) had COVID-19, among whom 15 612 patients (26.0%) died. COVID-19 rates were significantly higher among Black (21 787 of 165 830 patients [13.1%]) and Hispanic (13 530 of 86 871 patients [15.6%]) patients compared with non-Black patients (38 303 of 332 339 [11.5%]), as well as patients with short (ie, 1-89 days; 7738 of 55 184 patients [14.0%]) and extended (ie, ?90 days; 10 737 of 30 196 patients [35.6%]) nursing home stays in the prior year. Adjusting for all other risk factors, residing in a nursing home 1 to 89 days in the prior year was associated with a higher hazard for COVID-19 (hazard ratio [HR] vs 0 days, 1.60; 95% CI 1.56-1.65) and for postdiagnosis mortality (HR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.25-1.37), as was residing in a nursing home for an extended stay (COVID-19: HR, 4.48; 95% CI, 4.37-4.59; mortality: HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.07-1.16). Black race (HR vs non-Black: HR, 1.25; 95% CI, 1.23-1.28) and Hispanic ethnicity (HR vs non-Hispanic: HR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.64-1.72) were associated with significantly higher hazards of COVID-19. Although home dialysis was associated with lower COVID-19 rates (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.75-0.80), it was associated with higher mortality (HR, 1.18; 95% CI, 1.11-1.25).Conclusions and Relevance: These results shed light on COVID-19 risk factors and outcomes among Medicare patients receiving long-term chronic dialysis and could inform policy decisions to mitigate the significant extra burden of COVID-19 and death in this population.",

We aimed to inve stigate how and to what extent has GI trainees in Turkey are affected by the current pandemic in terms of general, psychological, and educational status.METHODS: We conducted a web-based survey sent electronically to 103 official GI trainees in Turkey from 37 centers. The 32-item survey included questions to capture demographic (5-questions), endoscopic (7-questions), personal protective equipment (PPE) (3-questions), psychological and general well-being (11-questions), and educational (6-questions) data.RESULTS: Ninety-six (93.2%) trainees completed the survey, of which 56.3% (n = 54) reported a decrease in independently performed endoscopic procedures. Due to pandemic, 91.7% of standard diagnostic endoscopic procedures, 57.2% of standard therapeutic procedures, and 67.7% of advanced endoscopic procedures were decreased. Out of 96 respondents, we detected signs of anxiety in 88.5%, exposure concern in 92.7%, concerns for prolongation of training period in 49%, loss of concentration and interest in 47.9%, and burnout syndrome in 63.5%. Female gender (odds-ratio: 3.856, 95% confidence interval: 1.221-12.174, P = .021) was the only independently associated factor with pandemic-related anxiety.CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 pandemic has led to high amounts of anxiety and non-negligible rates of burnout syndrome among GI trainees, with a significant reduction in endoscopic activities. More effort and novel strategies are required to deliver sufficient competence and general-psychological well-being to GI trainees.",

Data were linked to national death registers to determine deaths and their causes, with additional details obtained from ANZDATA.PARTICIPANTS: Of 82 844 people with kidney failure, 33 329 were female (40%) and 49 555 were male (60%); 49 376 deaths (20 099 in female patients; 29 277 in male patients) were recorded over a total of 536 602 person years of follow-up.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relative measures of survival, including standardised mortality ratios, relative survival, and years of life lost, using general population data to account for background mortality (adjusting for country, age, sex, and year). Estimates were stratified by dialysis modality (haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis) and for the subpopulation of kidney transplant recipients.RESULTS: Few differences in outcomes were found between male and female patients with kidney failure. However, compared with the general population, female patients with kidney failure had greater excess all cause deaths than male patients (female patients: standardised mortality ratio 11.3, 95% confidence interval 11.2 to 11.5, expected deaths 1781, observed deaths 20 099; male patients: 6.9, 6.8 to 6.9, expected deaths 4272, observed deaths 29 277). The greatest difference was observed among younger patients and those who died from cardiovascular disease. Relative survival was also consistently lower in female patients, with adjusted excess mortality 11% higher (95% confidence interval 8% to 13%). Average years of life lost was 3.6 years (95% confidence interval 3.6 to 3.7) greater in female patients with kidney failure compared with male patients across all ages. No major differences were found in mortality by sex for haemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Kidney transplantation reduced but did not entirely remove the sex difference in excess mortality, with similar relative survival (P=0.83) and years of life lost difference reduced to 2.3 years (95% confidence interval 2.2 to 2.3) between female and male patients.CONCLUSIONS: Compared with the general population, female patients had greater excess deaths, worse relative survival, and more years of life lost than male patients, however kidney transplantation reduced these differences. Future research should investigate whether systematic differences exist in access to care and possible strategies to mitigate excess mortality among female patients.",

        "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Health Service (NHS) recommended that appropriate patients anticoagulated with warfarin should be switched to direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), requiring less frequent blood testing. Subsequently, a national safety alert was issued regarding patients being inappropriately coprescribed two anticoagulants following a medication change and associated monitoring.OBJECTIVE: To describe which people were switched from warfarin to DOACs; identify potentially unsafe coprescribing of anticoagulants; and assess whether abnormal clotting results have become more frequent during the pandemic.METHODS: With the approval of NHS England, we conducted a cohort study using routine clinical data from 24 million NHS patients in England.RESULTS: 20 000 of 164 000 warfarin patients (12.2%) switched to DOACs between March and May 2020, most commonly to edoxaban and apixaban. Factors associated with switching included: older age, recent renal function test, higher number of recent INR tests recorded, atrial fibrillation diagnosis and care home residency. There was a sharp rise in coprescribing of warfarin and DOACs from typically 50-100 per month to 246 in April 2020, 0.06% of all people receiving a DOAC or warfarin. International normalised ratio (INR) testing fell by 14% to 506.8 patients tested per 1000 warfarin patients each month. We observed a very small increase in elevated INRs (n=470) during April compared with January (n=420).CONCLUSIONS: Increased switching of anticoagulants from warfarin to DOACs was observed at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic in England following national guidance. There was a small but substantial number of people coprescribed warfarin and DOACs during this period. Despite a national safety alert on the issue, a widespread rise in elevated INR test results was not found. Primary care has responded rapidly to changes in patient care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the Arizona Sexual Experience Scale (ASEX) were applied to the participants after obtaining sociodemographic data.RESULTS:  The depression scores of pregnant and non-pregnant women were similar (p = 0.846). We found that the depression scores were significantly higher among the group of participants who have lower economic status (p = 0.046). Moreover, the depression score was significantly higher among women who lost their income during the pandemic (p = 0.027). The score on the ASEX was significantly higher, and sexual dysfunction was more prevalent among women who have lower levels of schooling and income (p < 0.05). Likewise, the ASEX scores were significantly higher (p = 0.019) among the group who experienced greater income loss throughout the pandemic. Upon comparing the pregnant and non-pregnant groups, we detected that sexual dysfunction had a significantly higher rate among pregnant women (p < 0.001).CONCLUSION:  In times of global crisis, such as the current pandemic, low-income families have an increased risk of experiencing depression and sexual dysfunction.

Cisplatin (Csp) is a platinum-derived anti-neoplastic agent. This experiment aimed to identify the early signs of gentamicin and cisplatin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. Thirty Wistar rats were divided into three groups of 10: a control group, which received no treatment; a gentamicin group administered by a dose of (100 mg/kg, IP) for 7 consecutive days, and a cisplatin group was administered intraperitoneal in a dose of (1.5 mg/kg body weight) repeated twice a week for 3 weeks.RESULTS: Both experimental groups exhibited increased levels of creatinine, urea, and uric acid, with the cisplatin-treated group showing higher levels than the gentamicin group. Experimental groups also exhibited significantly increased Malondialdehyde (MDA), reduced glutathione (GSH), and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px) with more pronounced effects in the cisplatin-treated group. Further, both experimental groups exhibited significant up-regulation of Tumor Necrosis Factor � (TNF-�), caspase-3, and Bax and down regulation of Bcl-2.CONCLUSION: These findings confirm the use of necrotic, apoptotic genes as early biomarkers in the detection of tubular kidney damage. Further, cisplatin was shown to have a greater nephrotoxic effect than gentamicin; therefore, its use should be constrained accordingly when co-administered with gentamicin.",

Apparent digestibility of dietary nutrients, fecal microbiota, fecal fermentation products and immunological parameters were evaluated. Twenty-seven healthy cats of mixed sexes, with a mean body weight of 4.19 � 0.83 kg and a mean age of 9.44 � 5.35 years were distributed by age in an unbalanced randomized block design, consisting of three experimental treatments: CD (control diet), YAM 0.3 (control diet with 0.3% yeast with active metabolites) and YAM 0.6 (control diet with 0.6% yeast with active metabolites).RESULTS: The inclusion of the additive elevated the apparent digestibility of crude fiber (p = 0.013) and ash (p < 0.001) without interfering feed consumption, fecal production and fecal characteristics. Regarding fermentation products present in the feces, prebiotic inclusion increased lactic acid concentration (p = 0.004) while reducing isovaleric acid (p = 0.014), only in the treatment YAM 0.3. No differences were noticed on biogenic amines (BA), fecal pH, ammonia concentration, total and individuals short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and total and individuals branched-chain fatty acids (BCFA) (except isovaleric acid in YAM 0.3). As regards to fecal microbiota, prebiotic inclusion has resulted in the reduction of Clostridium perfringens (p = 0.023). No differences were found in the immunological parameters evaluated.CONCLUSION: It can be concluded that the additive, at the levels of inclusion assessed shows prebiotic potential and it has effects on fecal fermentation products and microbiota without interfering on crude protein and dry matter digestibility. More studies evaluating grater inclusion levels of the prebiotic are necessary to determine optimal concentration.",

The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic provides added impetus to realise these benefits, given the increased risk of secondary infection and nosocomial transmission of multi-drug-resistant (MDR) pathogens linked with the expansion of critical care capacity.METHODS: CMg using nanopore sequencing was evaluated in a proof-of-concept study on 43 respiratory samples from 34 intubated patients across seven intensive care units (ICUs) over a 9-week period during the first COVID-19 pandemic wave.RESULTS: An 8-h CMg workflow was 92% sensitive (95% CI, 75-99%) and 82% specific (95% CI, 57-96%) for bacterial identification based on culture-positive and culture-negative samples, respectively. CMg sequencing reported the presence or absence of �-lactam-resistant genes carried by Enterobacterales that would modify the initial guideline-recommended antibiotics in every case. CMg was also 100% concordant with quantitative PCR for detecting Aspergillus fumigatus from 4 positive and 39 negative samples. Molecular typing using 24-h sequencing data identified an MDR-K. pneumoniae ST307 outbreak involving 4 patients and an MDR-C. striatum outbreak involving 14 patients across three ICUs.CONCLUSION: CMg testing provides accurate pathogen detection and antibiotic resistance prediction in a same-day laboratory workflow, with assembled genomes available the next day for genomic surveillance. The provision of this technology in a service setting could fundamentally change the multi-disciplinary team approach to managing ICU infections. The potential to improve the initial targeted treatment and rapidly detect unsuspected outbreaks of MDR-pathogens justifies further expedited clinical assessment of CMg.",

The impact of the pandemic on the different types of pedagogical activities, and the displacement of pedagogical activities to online modalities have not yet been quantified. We sought to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on formal pedagogic components of otorhinolaryngology-head and neck surgery (ORL-HNS) residency, the switch to distance learning and program director's perceptions of the future of teaching and learning.METHODS: A nationwide online survey was conducted on Canadian ORL-HNS program directors. The use of standard didactic activities in-person and online, before and during the pandemic was rated with Likert scales. Perceptions of the pandemic were described with open-ended questions.RESULTS: A total of 11 of the 13 program directors contacted responded. The analysis were conducted using nonparametric statistics. There was a significant drop in overall didactic activities during the pandemic, regardless of the teaching format (3.5 � 0.2 to 3.1 � 0.3, p < 0.05). The most affected activities were simulation and in-house lectures. Online activities increased dramatically (0.5 � 0.2 to 5.0 � 0.5, p < 0.001), including attendance to lectures made by other programs (0.5 � 0.3 to 4.0 � 0.8, p < 0.05). Respondents stated their intention to maintain the hybrid online and in-person teaching model.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that hybrid online and in-person teaching is likely to persist in the post-pandemic setting. A balanced residency curriculum requires diversity in academic activities.

Since then, the RV approach has widely been used to discover potential vaccine protein targets by screening whole genome sequences of pathogens using a combination of sophisticated computational algorithms and bioinformatic tools. In contrast to conventional vaccine development strategies, RV offers a novel method to facilitate rapid vaccine design and reduces reliance on the traditional, relatively tedious, and labor-intensive approach based on Pasteur\"s principles of isolating, inactivating, and injecting the causative agent of an infectious disease. Advances in biocomputational techniques have remarkably increased the significance for the rapid identification of the proteins that are secreted or expressed on the surface of pathogens. Immunogenic proteins which are able to induce the immune response in the hosts can be predicted based on the immune epitopes present within the protein sequence. To date, RV has successfully been applied to develop vaccines against a variety of infectious pathogens. In this chapter, we apply a pipeline of bioinformatic programs for identification of Shigella flexneri potential vaccine candidates as an illustration immunoinformatic tools available for RV.",

The commercial availability of antibody preparations from donated human plasma, containing antibodies against many common gram-positive pathogens, allows the protocol to be performed in the absence of bespoke vaccination experiments.

As one of the highest throughput technologies for antigen discovery, proteome microarrays are a translational research tool for identification of vaccine candidates and biomarkers of susceptibility or protection from microbial challenge. The application has been expanded in recent years due to increased availability of bacterial genomic sequences for a broader range of species and strain diversity. Panproteome microarrays now allow for fine characterization of antibody specificity and cross-reactivity that may be relevant to vaccine design and biomarker discovery, as well as a fuller understanding of factors underlying themes of bacterial evolution and host-pathogen interactions. In this chapter, we present a workflow for design of panproteome microarrays and demonstrate statistical analysis of panproteomic human antibody responses to bacterial vaccination and challenge. Focus is particularly drawn to the bioinformatics and statistical tools and providing nontrivial, real examples that may help foster hypotheses and rational design of panproteomic studies.",

This is a time-consuming procedure which may lead to less immunogenic material, as critical antigenic structures can be altered by chemical modification. A promising alternative approach is low-energy electron irradiation (LEEI). Like other types of ionizing radiation, it mainly acts by destroying nucleic acids but causes less damage to structural components like proteins. As the electrons have a limited penetration depth, LEEI is currently used for sterilization of surfaces. The inactivation of pathogens in liquids requires irradiation of the culture in a thin film to ensure complete penetration. Here, we describe two approaches for the irradiation of bacterial suspensions in a research scale. After confirmation of inactivation, the material can be directly used for vaccination, without any purification steps.",

Some TBDTs also have a surface lipoprotein (SLP) that assists in the efficient capture of the metal ion-containing host protein from which the metal ion is extracted. The challenges in producing the integral outer membrane protein for a commercial subunit vaccine prompted us to develop a hybrid antigen strategy in which surface loops of the TBDT are displayed on the lipoprotein, which can readily be produced as a soluble protein.

One challenge often affecting vaccine development is antigenic diversity or pathogen heterogeneity. Different strains produce immunologically heterogeneous virulence factors, therefore an effective vaccine needs to induce broad-spectrum host immunity to provide cross-protection. Recent advances in genomics and proteomics, particularly computational biology and structural biology, establishes structural vaccinology and highlights the feasibility of developing effective and precision vaccines. Here, we introduce the epitope- and structure-based vaccinology platform multiepitope-fusion-antigen (MEFA), and provide instructions to generate polyvalent MEFA immunogens for vaccine development. Conceptually, MEFA combines epitope vaccinology and structural vaccinology to enable a protein immunogen to present heterogeneous antigenic domains (epitopes) and to induce broadly protective immunity against different virulence factors, strains or diseases. Methodologically, the MEFA platform first identifies a safe, structurally stable and strongly immunogenic backbone protein and immunodominant (ideally neutralizing or protective) epitopes from heterogeneous strains or virulence factors of interest. Then, assisted with protein modeling and molecule dynamic simulation, MEFA integrates heterogeneous epitopes into a backbone protein via epitope substitution for a polyvalent�MEFA protein and mimics epitope native antigenicity. Finally, the MEFA protein is examined for broad immunogenicity in animal immunization, and assessed for potential application for multivalent vaccine development in preclinical studies.",

It has had a number of negative consequences for individuals and for whole societies. Individual effects of the pandemic include not only loss of life and of physical health, but also deteriorated quality of life.OBJECTIVE: This study examines the effect of core self-evaluations (CSE), social support and fear of COVID-19 on the well-being of university students in Poland during the COVID-19 pandemic.METHODS: We conducted an online survey on a nationwide group of 1,000 students of Polish universities. The survey was carried out between 1 and 15 March 2021. The respondents filled out the following set of tools: World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale, Core Self-Evaluations Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support and The Fear of COVID-19 Scale.RESULTS: The findings showed that core self-evaluations (CSE) were significantly positively associated with well-being in each of the four domains studied: physical health (r = 0.519), psychological (r = 0.763), social relationships (r = 0.465) and environment (r = 0.496). Similarly, social support correlated positively with physical health (r = 0.277), psychological health (r = 0.306), social relationships (r = 0.552) and environment (r = 0.496). Fear of COVID-19 correlated negatively with well-being in the domain of physical health (r = 0.188), in social relationships (r = 0.042) and with regard to the environment (r = 0.071), the correlations were weak. However, the relationship between fear of COVID-19 and well-being in the psychological domain was not confirmed.CONCLUSION: The findings point to the significant role of CSE and the role of social support in the perceived quality of life of young people during the pandemic. They provide valuable data concerning individuals who are particularly vulnerable to the adverse psychological effects at the time of the pandemic. They also prove that research conducted to explore other factors protecting individual well-being in difficult situations, including that of the pandemic, should be continued.",

Integrating the ecological approach to media and cultural psychology, as well as the intergroup perspective of social psychology, we conducted a study that explored the impact of traditional media exposure to discrimination on collective anger-a process mediated by national identity among the Chinese migrants. Findings provide some evidence that geographically dispersed mono-cultural groups may share or identify with collective emotions when facing xenophobic threats in a macro context. Further examination of cultural distance (between China and the host country) among the Chinese migrants also revealed a particular interaction between host newspaper coverage and cultural distance on national identity. These findings suggest further research to examine the emotional norms of similar cultures bonded via strong collective identities in times of intergroup threat and the theoretical possibility for diasporic identity processes.",

In the same period, Ethiopia reported 102K cases and 1.5K deaths. Effective public health preparedness and response to COVID-19 requires timely projections of the time and size of the peak of the outbreak. Currently, Ethiopia under the COVAX facility has begun vaccinating high risk populations but due to vaccine supply shortages and the absence of an effective treatment, the implementation of NPIs (non-pharmaceutical interventions), like hand washing, wearing face coverings or social distancing, still remain the most effective methods of controlling the pandemic as recommended by WHO. This study proposes a modified Susceptible Exposed Infected and Recovered (SEIR) model to predict the number of COVID-19 cases at different stages of the disease under the implementation of NPIs at different adherence levels in both urban and rural settings of Ethiopia. To estimate the number of cases and their peak time, 30 different scenarios were simulated. The results indicated that the peak time of the pandemic is different in urban and rural populations of Ethiopia. In the urban population, under moderate implementation of three NPIs the pandemic will be expected to reach its peak in December, 2020 with 147,972 cases, of which 18,100 are symptomatic and 957 will require admission to an Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Among the implemented NPIs, increasing the coverage of wearing masks by 10% could reduce the number of new cases on average by one-fifth in urban-populations. Varying the coverage of wearing masks in rural populations minimally reduces the number of cases. In conclusion, the models indicate that the projected number of hospital cases during the peak time is higher than the Ethiopian health system capacity. To contain symptomatic and ICU cases within the health system capacity, the government should pay attention to the strict implementation of the existing NPIs or impose additional public health measures.",

Subjects (N = 5874; 51% female) were adults, 18 years and older, who completed a March survey (wave 1) and a follow-up survey one month later (wave 3). Analyses assessed the relationships of social media use at wave 1 with wave 3 alcohol use frequency, accounting for wave 1 alcohol use frequency and the sociodemographic characteristics of the sample. Two alcohol use change variables were also assessed as outcomes-increased and decreased alcohol use between waves. We considered the effect of work status changes (working/studying from home and job loss) as potential moderators.RESULTS: Twitter and Instagram users and users of multiple social media platforms, but not Facebook users, drank more frequently at wave 3. The results were similar when assessing relationships between social media use and increased alcohol use between waves. For Instagram users, more frequent alcohol use at wave 3 was at least partially attributed to drinking frequency at wave 1. Additionally, working/studying from home at wave 3 and employment (rather than job loss) were associated with greater consumption. The interaction effect between Twitter use and working/studying from home was statistically significant in association with alcohol use frequency at wave 3, as was the interaction effect between using multiple platforms and working/studying from home in association with decreased alcohol use between waves.DISCUSSION: Exposure to content about COVID-19 and increased alcohol consumption during the pandemic may have contributed to more frequent alcohol use for some social media users. The study of public health messaging via social media to change alcohol use behaviors during traumatic events is warranted.",

In addition, there are concerns of SARS-CoV-2 infection causing psychiatric illness; however, evidence of a direct effect is inconclusive.Objective: To assess risk of risk of incident or repeat psychiatric illness, fatigue, or sleep problems following SARS-CoV-2 infection and to analyze changes according to demographic subgroups.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cohort study assembled matched cohorts using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink Aurum, a UK primary care registry of 11 923 499 individuals aged 16 years or older. Patients were followed-up for up to 10 months, from February 1 to December 9, 2020. Individuals with less than 2 years of historical data or less than 1 week follow-up were excluded. Individuals with positive results on a SARS-CoV-2 test without prior mental illness or with anxiety or depression, psychosis, fatigue, or sleep problems were matched with up to 4 controls based on sex, general practice, and year of birth. Controls were individuals who had negative SARS-CoV-2 test results. Data were analyzed from January to July 2021.Exposure: SARS-CoV-2 infection, determined via polymerase chain reaction testing.Main Outcomes and Measures: Cox proportional hazard models estimated the association between a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result and subsequent psychiatric morbidity (depression, anxiety, psychosis, or self-harm), sleep problems, fatigue, or psychotropic prescribing. Models adjusted for comorbidities, ethnicity, smoking, and body mass index.Results: Of 11 923 105 eligible individuals (6 011 020 [50.4%] women and 5 912 085 [49.6%] men; median [IQR] age, 44 [30-61] years), 232 780 individuals (2.0%) had positive result on a SARS-CoV-2 test. After applying selection criteria, 86 922 individuals were in the matched cohort without prior mental illness, 19 020 individuals had prior anxiety or depression, 1036 individuals had psychosis, 4152 individuals had fatigue, and 4539 individuals had sleep problems. After adjusting for observed confounders, there was an association between positive SARS-CoV-2 test results and psychiatric morbidity (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 1.83; 95% CI, 1.66-2.02), fatigue (aHR, 5.98; 95% CI, 5.33-6.71), and sleep problems (aHR, 3.16; 95% CI, 2.64-3.78). However, there was a similar risk of incident psychiatric morbidity for those with a negative SARS-CoV-2 test results (aHR, 1.71; 95% CI, 1.65-1.77) and a larger increase associated with influenza (aHR, 2.98; 95% CI, 1.55-5.75).Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study of individuals registered at an English primary care practice during the pandemic, there was consistent evidence that SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with increased risk of fatigue and sleep problems.

Of 4632 patients screened at 396 centers in 32 countries, 2572 patients with heart failure, LVEF of more than 40%, elevated NT-proBNP levels, structural heart disease, and reduced quality of life were enrolled (last follow-up, October 28, 2019).Interventions: Patients were randomized 1:1 either to sacubitril/valsartan (n = 1286) or to background medication-based individualized comparator (n = 1286), ie, enalapril, valsartan, or placebo stratified by prior use of a renin angiotensin system inhibitor.Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary end points were change from baseline in plasma NT-proBNP level at week 12 and in the 6-minute walk distance at week 24. Secondary end points were change from baseline in quality of life measures and New York Heart Association (NYHA) class at 24 weeks.Results: Among 2572 randomized patients (mean age, 72.6 years [SD, 8.5 years]; 1301 women [50.7%]), 2240 (87.1%) completed the trial. At baseline, the median NT-proBNP levels were 786 pg/mL in the sacubitril/valsartan group and 760 pg/mL in the comparator group. After 12 weeks, patients in the sacubitril/valsartan group (adjusted geometric mean ratio to baseline, 0.82 pg/mL) had a significantly greater reduction in NT-proBNP levels than did those in the comparator group (adjusted geometric mean ratio to baseline, 0.98 pg/mL) with an adjusted geometric mean ratio of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.80 to 0.88; P < .001). At week 24, there was no significant between-group difference in median change from baseline in the 6-minute walk distance with an increase of 9.7 m vs 12.2 m (adjusted mean difference, -2.5 m; 95% CI, -8.5 to 3.5; P = .42). There was no significant between-group difference in the mean change in the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire clinical summary score (12.3 vs 11.8; mean difference, 0.52; 95% CI, -0.93 to 1.97) or improvement in NYHA class (23.6% vs 24.0% of patients; adjusted odds ratio, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.81 to 1.18). The most frequent adverse events in the sacubitril/valsartan group vs the comparator group were hypotension (14.1% vs 5.5%), albuminuria (12.3% vs 7.6%), and hyperkalemia (11.6% vs 10.9%).Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with heart failure and left ventricular ejection factor of higher than 40%, sacubitril/valsartan treatment compared with standard renin angiotensin system inhibitor treatment or placebo resulted in a significantly greater decrease in plasma N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels at 12 weeks but did not significantly improve 6-minute walk distance at 24 weeks. Further research is warranted to evaluate potential clinical benefits of sacubitril/valsartan in these patients.Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03066804.",

In addition to breast augmentation, implants can be used for postmastectomy breast reconstruction, correction of congenital breast anomalies, breast or chest wall deformities, and male-to-female top surgery. Breast implants may confer significant benefits to patients, but several factors are important to consider preoperatively, including the impact on mammography, future lactation, and potential long-term implant complications (e.g., infection, capsular contracture, rupture, and the need for revision, replacement, or removal). A fundamental understanding of implant monitoring is also paramount to implant use. Patients with silicone breast implants should undergo routine screening for implant rupture with magnetic resonance imaging or ultrasonography completed five to six years postoperatively and then every two to three years thereafter. With the exception of complications, there are no formal recommendations regarding the timing of breast implant removal or exchange. Women with unilateral breast swelling should be evaluated with ultrasonography for an effusion that might indicate breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma. There are no specific breast cancer screening recommendations for patients with breast implants, but special mammographic views are indicated to enhance accuracy. Although these discussions are a routine component of consultation and postoperative follow-up for plastic surgeons performing these procedures, family physicians should have a working knowledge of implant indications, characteristics, and complications to better counsel their patients, to ensure appropriate screening, and to coordinate care after surgery.",

This article presents recommendations related to patients with certain medical conditions who are planning to undergo common dental procedures, such as cleanings, extractions, restorations, endodontic procedures, abscess drainage, and mucosal biopsies. Specifically, prophylactic antibiotics are not recommended for preventing prosthetic joint infections or infectious endocarditis except in certain circumstances. Anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapies typically should not be suspended for common dental treatments. Elective dental care should be avoided for six weeks after myocardial infarction or bare-metal stent placement or for six months after drug-eluting stent placement. It is important that any history of antiresorptive or antiangiogenic therapies be communicated to the dentist. Ascites is not an indication for initiating prophylactic antibiotics before dental treatment, and acetaminophen is the analgesic of choice for patients with liver dysfunction or cirrhosis who abstain from alcohol. Nephrotoxic medications should be avoided in patients with chronic kidney disease, and the consultation should include the patient's glomerular filtration rate. Although patients undergoing chemotherapy may receive routine dental care, it should be postponed when possible in those currently undergoing head and neck radiation therapy. A detailed history of head and neck radiation therapy should be provided to the dentist. Multimodal, nonnarcotic analgesia is recommended for managing acute dental pain.",

Primary care clinicians should refer people at risk of ESRD to nephrology to optimize disease management. Kidney transplantation typically yields the best patient outcomes, although most patients are treated with dialysis. The decision to initiate dialysis is best made through shared decision-making. Because most patients with ESRD elect to receive hemodialysis, the preservation of peripheral veins is important for those with stage III to V chronic kidney disease. A palliative approach to ESRD is a reasonable alternative to dialysis, particularly for individuals with limited life expectancy, with severe comorbid conditions, or who wish to avoid medical interventions. For patients with ESRD, vaccination against seasonal influenza, tetanus, hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (through 26 years of age), and Streptococcus pneumoniae is advised. Routine cancer screening for patients not receiving kidney transplantation is discouraged. Controlling blood pressure in patients receiving dialysis improves mortality. Volume control through adequate dialysis and sodium restriction can help optimize hypertension treatment in these patients. Insulin is the preferred treatment for patients with ESRD and diabetes mellitus requiring medication. Patients should be monitored for signs of protein-energy wasting and malnutrition. Clinicians must be aware of the many medical complications associated with ESRD.",

Early detection and management of fetal growth restriction are essential because it has significant clinical implications in childhood. It is diagnosed by estimated fetal weight or abdominal circumference below the 10th percentile on formal ultrasonography. Early-onset fetal growth restriction is diagnosed before 32 weeks' gestation and has a higher risk of adverse fetal outcomes. There are no evidence-based measures for preventing fetal growth restriction; however, aspirin used for the prevention of preeclampsia in high-risk pregnancies may reduce the likelihood of developing it. Timing of delivery for pregnancies affected by growth restriction must be adjusted based on the risks of premature birth and ongoing gestation, and it is best determined in consultation with maternal-fetal medicine specialists. Neonates affected by fetal growth restriction are at risk of feeding difficulties, glucose instability, temperature instability, and jaundice. As these children age, they are at risk of abnormal growth patterns, as well as later cardiac, metabolic, neurodevelopmental, reproductive, and psychiatric disorders.",

A history and physical examination guide diagnostic testing.

Neuroimaging with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging should be performed when the initial evaluation does not identify a cause or raises concern for intracranial pathology. Lumbar puncture and electroencephalography are also important diagnostic tests in the evaluation of AMS. Patients at increased risk of AMS benefit from preventive measures. The underlying etiology determines the definitive treatment. When intervention is needed to control patient behaviors that threaten themselves or others, nonpharmacologic interventions are preferred to medications.

Echocardiograms were performed to assess left ventricular (LV), right ventricular (RV) and pulmonary variables along with collection of patient demographics, comorbid conditions, blood biomarkers and outcomes.RESULT: In the predominant non-white (72%) population, RV dysfunction was the primary cardiac abnormality noted in 50% of patients, with RV fractional area change <35% being the most common marker of this RV dysfunction. By comparison, LV systolic dysfunction occurred in 18% of patients. RV dysfunction was associated with LV systolic dysfunction and the presence of a D-shaped LV throughout the cardiac cycle (marker of significant pulmonary artery hypertension). LV systolic dysfunction (p=0.002, HR 3.82, 95% CI 1.624 to 8.982), pulmonary valve acceleration time (p=0.024, HR 0.98, 95% CI 0.964 to 0.997)-marker of increased pulmonary vascular resistance, age (p=0.047, HR 1.027, 95% CI 1.000 to 1.055) and an episode of tachycardia measured from admission to time of echo (p=0.004, HR 6.183, 95% CI 1.772 to 21.575) were independently associated with mortality.CONCLUSIONS: In this predominantly non-white population hospitalised with COVID-19, the most common cardiac pathology was RV dysfunction which is associated with both LV systolic dysfunction and elevated pulmonary artery pressure. The latter two, not RV dysfunction, were associated with mortality.",

The expansion of the tick Ixodes ricinus (Linnaeus, 1758) in northern Europe due to climate change is of serious concern for animal and human health. The aim of the present study was to investigate the impact of A. phagocytophilum infection in moose Alces alces (Linnaeus) calves by evaluating the carcass weights of infected and non-infected animals and examining animal tissues samples for co-infections with either species of Babesia Starcovici, 1893 or bacteria of the genus Bartonella. The carcasses of 68 free-ranging moose calves were weighed by hunters during the hunting seasons from 2014 to 2017 in two regions in southern Norway and spleen samples were collected. Anaplasma phagocytophilum was detected in moose sampled from locations infected with ticks with a prevalence of 82% (n = 46). The carcass weights of A. phagocytophilum-infected calves (n = 46) and non-infected (n = 22) calves were compared. Although the average weight of infected calves (45.6 kg) was lower than that of non-infected calves (46.5 kg), the difference was not statistically significant. Three different variants of the bacterium 16S rRNA gene were identified. The average weight of animals infected with variant I was 49.9 kg, whereas that of animals infected with variant III was 42.0 kg, but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.077). Co-infections of A. phagocytophilum with Bartonella spp. or with Babesia spp. were found in 20 and two calves, respectively. A triple infection was found in two calves. Sequence analysis of the 18S rRNA gene of Babesia-positive samples revealed the presence of Babesia cf. odocoilei (Emerson et Wright, 1970). Strains of Bartonella closely related to Bartonella bovis (Bermond, Boulouis, Heller, Laere, Monteil, Chomel, Sander, Dehio et Piemont, 2002) were identified based on phylogenetic analysis of the gltA and rpoB genes.

The authors have implemented an efficient preprocessing and classification technique for respiratory disease detection. In this proposed method, the histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) algorithm, Haar transform (Haar), and local binary pattern (LBP) algorithm were applied on lung X-ray images to extract the best features and segment the left lung and right lung. The segmentation of lungs from the X-ray can improve the accuracy of results in COVID-19 detection algorithms or any machine/deep learning techniques. The segmented lungs are validated over intersection over union scores to compare the algorithms. The preprocessed X-ray image results in better accuracy in classification for all three classes (normal/COVID-19/pneumonia) than unprocessed raw images.

We enrolled ten adult patients hospitalized with symptomatic coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Respiratory and stool specimens were collected by physicians. The presence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. All ten patients had respiratory symptoms, six had diarrhea, and seven were positive for SARS-CoV-2 on rectal swabs. The viral loads in the respiratory specimens was higher than those in the rectal specimens, and no rectal specimens were positive after the respiratory specimens became negative. There was no association between gastrointestinal symptoms, pneumonia, severity, and rectal viral load. Rectal swabs may play a role in detecting SARS-CoV-2 in individuals with suspected COVID-19, regardless of gastrointestinal symptoms.",

Demographic, clinical and laboratory data, pharmacotherapy, and neonatal outcomes were analyzed. These outcomes were compared between patients that were discharged from ICU and patients who died in ICU.RESULTS: Nineteen women were included in this study. Additional oxygen was required in all cases (100%). Eight patients (42%) were intubated and mechanically ventilated. All patients that were mechanically ventilated have died. Increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) was seen in all patients (100%). D-dimer values increased in 15 patients (78.9%); interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased in 16 cases (84.2%). Sixteen patients used antiviral drugs. Eleven patients were discharged from the ICU and eight patients have died due to complications of COVID-19 showing an ICU mortality rate of 42.1%. Mean number of hospitalized days in ICU was significantly lower in patients that were discharged (P = 0.037). Seventeen patients underwent cesarean-section (C/S) (89.4%). Mean birth week was significantly lower in patients who died in ICU (P = 0.024). Eleven preterm (57.8%) and eight term deliveries (42.1%) occurred.CONCLUSION: High mortality rate was detected among critically ill pregnant/parturient patients followed in the ICU. Main predictors of mortality were the need of invasive mechanical ventilation and higher number of days hospitalized in ICU. Rate of C/S operations and preterm delivery were high. Pleasingly, the rate of neonatal death was low and no neonatal COVID-19 occurred.",

HCW are essential workers performing any job in a healthcare setting who are potentially directly or indirectly exposed to infectious materials. Our retrospective cohort study aimed to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 infections among HCW in Jakarta and neighbouring areas during the first three months of the pandemic.METHODS: Nasopharyngeal/oropharyngeal swab specimens from HCW working at private and public hospitals in Jakarta and neighbouring areas were screened for SARS-CoV-2 between March and May 2020. Data on demography, clinical symptoms, contact history, and personal protective equipment (PPE) use were collected using standardised forms.RESULTS: Among 1201 specimens, 7.9% were confirmed positive for SARS-CoV-2 with the majority coming from medical doctors (48.4%) and nurses (44.2%). 64.2% of the positive cases reported to have contact with suspect/confirmed COVID-19 cases, including 32 (52.2%) with patient and 3 (6.6%) with co-worker. The symptomatic HCW had a significantly lower median Ct value as compared to their asymptomatic counterpart (p < .001). Tendency to have a higher prevalence of pneumonia was observed in the age group of 40 - 49 and ?50 years old.CONCLUSION: Our findings highlighted the necessity to implement proper preventive and surveillance strategies for this high-risk population including adherence to strict PPE protocol and appropriate training.Key MessageHealthcare workers (HCW), defined as those handling any job in a healthcare setting, are at the frontline of risk of infection as SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmitted through airborne droplets and direct contact with contaminated surfaces. The aim of our study is to attain a more comprehensive and accurate picture of the impact of COVID-19 on HCW during the earlier phase of the outbreak in Indonesia to develop effective strategies that protect the health and safety of this workforce. Our findings highlighted that COVID-19 infections in HCW were mostly acquired in healthcare settings, with significant consequences of pneumonia and hospitalisation occurring across all age groups.",

SARS-CoV-2 has been found to cause multiple organ damage; however, little attention has been paid to the damage to the endocrine system caused by this virus, and the subsequent impact on prognosis. This may be the first research on the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis and prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).METHODS: In this retrospective observational study, 235 patients were admitted to the hospital with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection from 22 January to 17 March 2020. Clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and treatments were obtained from electronic medical records with standard data collection forms and compared among patients with different thyroid function status.RESULTS: Among 235 patients, 17 (7.23%) had subclinical hypothyroidism, 11 (4.68%) severe non-thyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS), and 23 (9.79%) mild to moderate NTIS. Composite endpoint events of each group, including mortality, admission to the ICU, and using IMV were observed. Compared with normal thyroid function, the hazard ratios (HRs) of composite endpoint events for mild to moderate NTIS, severe NTIS, subclinical hypothyroidism were 27.3 (95% confidence interval [CI] 7.07-105.7), 23.1 (95% CI 5.75-92.8), and 4.04 (95% CI 0.69-23.8) respectively. The multivariate-adjusted HRs for acute cardiac injury among patients with NTF, subclinical hypothyroidism, severe NTIS, and mild to moderate NTIS were 1.00, 1.68 (95% CI 0.56-5.05), 4.68 (95% CI 1.76-12.4), and 2.63 (95% CI 1.09-6.36) respectively.CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that the suppression of the HPT axis could be a common complication in COVID-19 patients and an indicator of the severity of prognosis. Among the three different types of thyroid dysfunction with COVID-19, mild to moderate NTIS and severe NTIS have a higher risk of severe outcomes compared with subclinical hypothyroidism.",

Sequence analysis of the S and M segments suggested that the isolated AKAV strain was closely related to the AKAV strains JaGAr39 and JaLAB39, which belonged to AKAV genogroup II. To further study the pathogenic mechanism of AKAV, the full-length cDNA clone of TJ2016 S, M, and L segment was constructed separately into the TVT7R plasmid at the downsteam of T7 promoter and named as TVT7R-S, TVT7R-M, and TVT7R-L, respectively. The above three plasmids were further transfected into the BSR-T7/5 cells simultaneously with a ratio of 1:1:1 to produce the rescued virus AKAV. Compared with the parental wild type AKAV (wtAKAV), the rescued virus (rAKAV) was proved to be with similar cytopathic effects (CPE), plaque sizes and growth kinetics in BHK-21 cells.CONCLUSION: We successfully isolated a AKAV strain TJ2016 from the sera of cattle and established a reverse genetic platform for AKAV genome manipulation. The established reverse genetic system is also a powerful tool for further research on AKAV pathogenesis and even vaccine studies.",

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is associated with ARDS in the more severe cases. This study aimed to compare the specificity of the metabolic alterations induced by COVID-19 or Influenza A pneumonia (IAP) in ARDS.METHODS: Eighteen patients with ARDS due to COVID-19 and twenty patients with ARDS due to IAP, admitted to the intensive care unit. ARDS was defined as in the American-European Consensus Conference. As compared with patients with COVID-19, patients with IAP were younger and received more often noradrenaline to maintain a mean arterial pressure > 65�mm Hg. Serum samples were analyzed by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Multivariate Statistical Analyses were used to identify metabolic differences between groups. Metabolic pathway analysis was performed to identify the most relevant pathways involved in ARDS development.RESULTS: ARDS due to COVID-19 or to IAP induces a different regulation of amino acids metabolism, lipid metabolism, glycolysis, and anaplerotic metabolism. COVID-19 causes a significant energy supply deficit that induces supplementary energy-generating pathways. In contrast, IAP patients suffer more marked inflammatory and oxidative stress responses. The classificatory model discriminated against the cause of pneumonia with a success rate of 100%.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support the concept that ARDS is associated with a characteristic metabolomic profile that may discriminate patients with ARDS of different etiologies, being a potential biomarker for the diagnosis, prognosis, and management of this condition.",

In this study, we aimed to evaluate the ratio of PIDD in the patients with BCG infections. Patients with BCG infections were analyzed in a tertiary referral centre in the 2015-2020 period. Forty-seven patients with BCGitis/BCGosis were evaluated; thirty-four (72.3%) had BCGitis, and 13 (27.7%) had BCGosis. Common tissue and organs affected are lymph nodes (57.4%), skin and subcutaneous tissue (48.9%), lungs (23.4%) and liver (17%). PIDD was shown in 26 patients (55.3%), including 92.3% of patients with BCGosis and 41.2% of patients with BCGitis. Ten patients had Mendelian susceptibility to Mycobacterial disease (MSMD) (21.2%), six had predominantly antibody deficiency (PAD) (12.7%), five had severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) (10.6%), three had CGD (6.3%), and two had CID (4.2%). Mortality was reported in two patients (4.2%) with CID (ZAP70 deficiency (n�=�1) and PIK3R1 deficiency (n�=�1)). Parental consanguinity (84%), axillary lymphadenopathy (65%), mycobacterial lung disease (42%), hepatomegaly (30%) and growth retardation (19%) were significantly high in patients with PIDD diagnosis. Isolated vaccination site infection was also recorded in patients with PIDD (CID (n�=�1), SCID (n�=�1), PAD (n�=�5)). BCG vaccination should be planned with caution for the cases with suspected PIDD. This study indicates that almost all patients (92.3%) with BCGosis and one in every two patients (41.2%) with BCGitis have an underlying PIDD. Parental consanguinity, axillary lymphadenopathy, mycobacterial lung disease, hepatomegaly and growth retardation (19%) are important clinical features in the differential diagnosis of PIDD.",

However, the establishment of maternal immune tolerance towards semi-allograft foetus is more exigent and is achieved predominantly by human leukocyte antigen-G (HLA-G) isoforms with a special emphasis on soluble HLA-G5 (sHLA-G5). Constant inflammation and lack of resolution by anti-inflammatory milieu, due to aberrant expression of critical immunoregulatory molecules such as sHLA-G5 and dysfunctional T helper cells 1 and 2 (Th1-Th2) cytokine shift, can lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes including recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL). Serum samples of 270 pregnant women (135 healthy parous and 135 with a history of RPL) were evaluated for the concentrations of sHLA-G5, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-�) using sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and found elevated levels of sHLA-G5 and IL-4 in controls and higher TNF-� levels and TNF-�:IL-4 ratio in patients (P�<�.05). Stratified data analysis based on the time of sample collection, that is the first and second trimesters exhibited higher sHLA-G5 and IL-4 in both first and second trimesters in controls than patients, while they displayed lower levels concerning TNF-� and TNF-�:IL-4 ratio (P�<�.05). However, within patients and controls in the first or second trimesters, there was a significant variation concerning sHLA-G5 alone. Further, the outcome of pregnancies studied in the present investigation revealed a significant elevation in sHLA-G5 levels among women with successful pregnancies compared with women who experienced pregnancy loss, therefore, concluding the potential application of sHLA-G5 isoform as a marker in assisting improved pregnancy outcomes.",

Sale of singles additionally deter implementation of tobacco control strategies of pictorial health warnings including plain packaging and defeat effective taxation and promote illicit trade. We review India's tobacco control policy responses towards banning singles and other products sold as loose tobacco and identify opportunities for future policy intervention especially in the context of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.METHODS: Existing national and sub-national policy documents were analyzed for their content since the inception of the tobacco control laws in the country.RESULTS: There are no effective provisions at national level to ban loose tobacco products in India. However, the implementation of multiple legislative and regulatory measures (Acts/circulars/letters/notifications/orders/court judgements) in 16 Indian states and jurisdictions provide sufficient legal framework to substantiate its complete ban pan India. While the majority of state governments have adopted state level measures, Rajasthan had issued specific directive to all the 33 districts banning loose cigarettes and other tobacco products. Himachal Pradesh introduced the most unique and comprehensive legislation, for banning the sale of cigarettes and beedis (Dated November 7, 2016). The most recent notification in the state of Maharashtra (September 24, 2020) is the first to leverage powers using a mix of national and state legislations including the legislation addressing the rapidly emerging challenge of managing COVID-19.CONCLUSION: A robust national policy which supports strong provision to deter tobacco companies, their distribution network and vendors from selling singles or loose tobacco products is urgently needed. Such policy should be backed by cautionary messaging for consumers as well. Eliminating singles and loose tobacco sale will help in blunting tobacco use prevalence besides curbing spread of infectious diseases like COVID-19 pandemic.",

        "abstractText": "Sexual minority men are at greater risk of depression and suicidality than heterosexuals. Stigma, the most frequently hypothesized risk factor for this disparity, operates across socioecological levels-structural (e.g., laws), interpersonal (e.g., discrimination), and individual (e.g., self-stigma). Although the literature on stigma and mental health has focused on interpersonal and individual forms of stigma, emerging research has shown that structural stigma is also associated with adverse mental health outcomes. However, there is limited data on whether changes in structural stigma, such as when a stigmatized person moves to a lower stigma context, affect mental health, and on the mechanisms underlying this association. To address these questions, we use data from the 2017/18 European Men-who-have-sex-with-men Internet Survey (n = 123,428), which assessed mental health (i.e., Patient Health Questionnaire) and psychosocial mediators (i.e., sexual orientation concealment, internalized homonegativity, and social isolation). We linked these data to an objective indicator of structural stigma related to sexual orientation-including 15 laws and policies as well as aggregated social attitudes-in respondents' countries of origin (N = 178) and receiving countries (N = 48). Among respondents who still live in their country of birth (N = 106,883), structural stigma was related to depression and suicidality via internalized homonegativity and social isolation. Among respondents who moved from higher-to-lower structural stigma countries (n = 11,831), longer exposure to the lower structural stigma environments of their receiving countries was associated with a significantly: 1) lower risk of depression and suicidality; 2) lower odds of concealment, internalized homonegativity, and social isolation; and 3) smaller indirect effect of structural stigma on mental health through these mediators. This study provides additional evidence that stigma is a sociocultural determinant of mental health. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).",

In a previous study wielding the power of computational psychiatry, we found alterations in learning from negative feedback and in neural activity in the posterior medial frontal cortex (pMFC) in young acutely underweight AN patients (acAN). Here we ask whether these abnormalities are merely a state-related consequence of the illness or whether they might constitute a trait marker predisposing individuals to AN. To address this question, we employed the same reinforcement learning paradigm during fMRI with 31 female former AN patients after complete weight-recovery (recAN) and 31 age-matched healthy volunteers (15-28 years). Participants performed a decision task that required adaptation to changing reward contingencies. Data were analyzed within a hierarchical Gaussian filter model, which captures interindividual variability in feedback learning and decision-making under uncertainty. Similar to acute patients, individuals recovered from AN appear to emphasize negative over positive feedback when updating expectations regarding changing reward-punishment contingencies (difference in learning rate between punished and rewarded trials was increased in recAN: p = .006, d = .70. This behavioral pattern was mirrored in hyperactivation of the pMFC following negative feedback (FWE p < .001). Because the previously observed alterations in acANs are also evident after recovery and do not correlate with state variables like weight, altered feedback learning might be a trait marker of AN. The neural underpinnings of these alterations may lie in the pMFC. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved).",

Little is known about functional processes that maintain restriction, especially outside of narrow diagnostic categories (e.g., anorexia nervosa). Here, we extend research on operant four-function models (identifying automatic negative, automatic positive, social negative, and social positive reinforcement functions) that have previously been applied to nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), binge eating, and purging to restricting. We assessed restrictive eating functions in three samples: clinically heterogeneous adolescents (Study 1: N = 457), transdiagnostic adults (Study 2: N = 145), and adults with acute or recently weight-restored anorexia nervosa (Study 3: N = 45). Study 1 indicated the four-function model was a good fit for restricting (root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = .06, Tucker-Lewis index [TLI] = .88). This factor structure replicated in Study 2 (comparative fit index [CFI] = .97, RMSEA = .07, TLI = .97, standardized root mean square residual [SRMR] = .09). Unlike NSSI, binge eating, and purging, which have been found to primarily serve automatic negative reinforcement functions, all three present studies found automatic positive reinforcement was most highly endorsed (by up to 85% of participants). In Studies 1 and 3, automatic functions were associated with poorer emotion regulation (ps < .05). In Study 1, social functions were associated with less social support (ps < .001). Across studies, automatic functions were associated with greater restriction ps < .05). Functions varied slightly by ED diagnosis. Across ED presentation, severity, and developmental stage, restrictive eating may be largely maintained by automatic positive reinforcement, with some variability across presentations. Continued examination of restrictive eating functions will establish processes that maintain restriction, allowing more precise treatment targeting for these problematic behaviors.

Overreactivity to nonpertinent prediction errors may lead to the attribution of one's own actions to an external source. When applied to perception, this could explain hallucinations. However, experiments in motor control or perception have mainly suggested deficient prediction errors. Using a novel approach based on the manipulation of temporal delays, 23 patients with schizophrenia, 18 patients with bipolar disorder, and 22 healthy participants performed a pointing task with a haptic device that provided haptic feedback without or with delays, which were processed consciously (65 ms) or unconsciously (15 ms). The processing of prediction errors was measured via the adaptation of the hand trajectory, that is, the deceleration in anticipation of the surface, and its modulation as a function of recent history (stable or unstable sensory feedback). Agency was evaluated by measuring the participants' feeling of controlling the device. Only patients with schizophrenia reported a decrease in the feeling of control following subliminally delayed haptic feedback and adapted deceleration durations following subliminally delayed haptic feedback. This effect was correlated with positive symptoms. The overreactivity to subliminal delays was present only when delays occurred repeatedly in an unpredictable way, that is, with a volatile distribution. The results suggest that small temporal uncertainties that should be held as negligible, trigger an aberrant overreactivity which could account for hallucinations and alterations of the patients' conscious feeling of control.

The current study investigated how high-level visual processing is affected in psychosis by presenting object stimuli with equivalent low-level visual features. Outpatients with affective and nonaffective psychotic disorders, first-degree biological relatives, and psychiatrically unaffected individuals (N = 130) completed the Fragmented Ambiguous Object Task (FAOT) to assess recognition of objects in ambiguous stimuli. During the task, we recorded electroencephalography, quantified event-related potential (ERP) components (P1, N1, negative closure [NCL], N400), and derived four spatiotemporal event-related potential factors using principal components analysis (PCA). In addition to traditional diagnoses, psychosis was characterized using a dimensional measure of individual differences in self-reported sensory experiences (perceptual absorption) calculated from scales that tap the psychotic domain of the hierarchical structure of psychopathology. Rates of detecting objects within fragmented stimuli failed to differ across diagnostic groups or significantly predict perceptual absorption (p = .057). PCA factors that reflected smaller N1 and larger NCL amplitudes were associated with detecting objects. Exploratory analyses revealed that higher perceptual absorption was associated with reductions in the N400 and a late positive PCA factor. Although early and midlatency brain responses modulate during object detection, late brain responses tied to semantic appraisal of objects are related to perceptual aberrations often reported by individuals with severe psychopathology. Dimensional measures of personality appear sensitive to variation in biological systems relevant to psychotic symptomatology and object perception.

The virus has been constantly mutating and local transmission cases from different countries vary due to host dependent viral adaptation. Many distinct clusters of variant SARS-CoV-2 have been defined globally. In this study, the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2 was studied and locally transmitted SARS-CoV-2 isolates from Karachi were sequenced to compared and identify any possible variants.METHODOLOGY: The real time PCR was performed on nasopharyngeal specimen to confirm SARS-CoV-2 with Orf 1ab and E gene as targets. The virus isolates were sequenced through oxford nanopore technology MinION platform. Isolates from the first and second wave of COVID-19 outbreak in Karachi were compared.RESULTS: The overall positivity rate for PCR was 26.24% with the highest number of positive cases in June. Approximately, 37.45% PCR positive subjects aged between 19-40 years. All the isolates belonged to GH clade and shared missense mutation D614G in spike protein linked to increased transmission rate worldwide. Another spike protein mutation A222V coexisted with D614G in the virus from the second wave of COVID-19.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the present findings it is suggested that the locally transmitted virus from Karachi varies from those reported from other parts of Pakistan. Slight variability was also observed between viruses from the first and second wave. Variability in any potential vaccine target may result in failed trials, therefore information on any local viral variants is always useful for effective vaccine design and/or selection.",

This study explores the vaccine demand, hesitancy, and nationalism as well as vaccine acceptance and domestic vaccine preference among young adults in Bangladesh.METHODOLOGY: This quantitative study followed the snowball sampling technique and collected responses from 1,018 individuals from various social media platforms. The analysis covered both descriptive and inferential statistics including chi-square, F-statistic, and logistic regression.RESULTS: The findings of the fully-adjusted regression model suggest that the individuals who had more vaccine demand were 3.29 times (95% confidence interval = 2.39-4.54; p < 0.001) higher to accept vaccine compared to those who had no vaccine demand. Conversely, vaccine hesitancy was negatively associated with vaccine acceptance. Here, the odds ratio was found 0.70 (95% confidence interval = 0.62-0.80; p < 0.001), which means that those who had higher vaccine hesitancy were about 30% less likely to accept vaccines than those who had no hesitancy. In addition, the persons who had vaccine nationalism were 1.75 times (95% confidence interval = 1.62-1.88; p < 0.001) more prone to prefer domestic vaccine.CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that policymakers may take initiatives for making people aware and knowledgeable about the severity and vulnerability to specific health threats. In this concern, perception and efficacy-increasing programs may take part in increasing protection motivation behaviors like vaccine acceptance and (domestic) vaccine preference.",

We aimed to analyze if obesity and diabetes prevalence are associated with higher COVID-19 mortality rates in Mexico.METHODOLOGY: We analyzed the mortality rate for each of the 2,457 municipalities in Mexico, one of the countries with highest COVID-19 mortality rate, during the first seven months of the pandemic to identify factors associated with higher mortality, including demographic, health-related characteristics (prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and hypertension in adults older than 20 years old), and altitude.RESULTS: During the first seven months of the COVID-19 pandemic there were 85,666 deaths reported in Mexico, with a cumulative mortality rate of 67 per 100,000 population. The mean mortality rate for the 2,457 municipalities in Mexico was 33.9 per 100,000 population. At a municipal level, the prevalence of diabetes and obesity, as well as high human development index, and location at < 500 or > 2000 above sea level were associated with higher mortality rate.CONCLUSIONS: Elevated obesity and diabetes prevalence explain, in part, high COVID-19 mortality rates registered in certain municipalities in Mexico.

Pneumonia was detected in 40.5% of the patients on their chest CT. A weak but significant correlation was found between SARS-CoV-2 Ct value detected with PCR in analysis of oropharyngeal/ nasopharyngeal (OP/NP) samples and chest CT score (Pearson's r: 0.197, p = 0.01). No correlation was found between the first detected viral load Ct value and age, gender and mortality. There was no significant correlation between chest CT score and mortality. While the areas remaining under ROC curve for Ct value in analysis of OP/NP samples in prediction of chest CT score ? 1, ? 5 and ? 10 were 0.564, 0.640 and 0.703 respectively.CONCLUSIONS: We found that the amount of SARS-CoV-2 viral load (inverse relationship with Ct) detected in OP/NP samples of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia did not reflect the increasing severity of pulmonary lesions on chest CT. Although primary target of SARS-CoV-2 is all epithelial cells of the respiratory tract we believe studies comparing viral loads in lower respiratory tract samples are needed to determine the severity of pulmonary disease.",

Cough, shortness of breath, fever and weakness were the most common four symptoms seen in all COVID-19 patients. Shortness of breath, myalgia, headache symptoms were more common in CoV-asthma than the other groups (p < 0.001, p < 0.01, p < 0.05 respectively). Sputum was more common in CoV-COPD than other groups (p < 0.01). COPD group most frequently had increased values, different from the other groups with CRP>5ng/mL in 91.3%, D-dimer > 0.05mg/dL in 89.1%, troponin > 0.014micg/L in %63.9, INR>1.15 in 52.2%, CK-MB>25U/L in 48.5%, PT>14s in 40.9% of patients (p < 0.05, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p < 0.05, p < 0.001, respectively). NT-ProBNP was found to have the highest AUC value and the best differentiating parameter for CoV-asthma from CoV-alone. Typical CT findings were present in 44.4% of CoV-alone, 57.5% of CoV-asthma, 28.3% of CoV-COPD and 38.9% of CoV-com groups. CoV-COPD and CoV-com patients died more frequently than other groups (17.8%, 18.5%).CONCLUSIONS: CoV-asthma and CoV-COPD patients might have different symptoms and laboratory parameters than other COVID-19 patients which can guide the physicians.",

As vaccines continue to be manufactured and administered, limiting the spread of SARS-CoV-2 will rely more heavily on the early identification of contagious individuals occupying reopened and increasingly populated indoor environments. In this study, we investigated the utility of an impaction-based bioaerosol sampling system with multiple nucleic acid collection media. Heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 was utilized to perform bench-scale, short-range aerosol, and room-scale aerosol experiments. Through bench-scale experiments, AerosolSense Capture Media (ACM) and nylon flocked swabs were identified as the highest utility media. In room-scale aerosol experiments, consistent detection of aerosol SARS-CoV-2 was achieved at an estimated aerosol concentration equal to or greater than 0.089 genome copies per liter of room air (gc/L) when air was sampled for eight hours or more at less than one air change per hour (ACH). Shorter sampling periods (75 minutes) yielded consistent detection at ~31.8 gc/L of room air and intermittent detection down to ~0.318 gc/L at (at both 1 and 6 ACH). These results support further exploration in real-world testing scenarios and suggest the utility of indoor aerosol surveillance as an effective risk mitigation strategy in occupied buildings.",

Although data on the immunological presentation of patients with COVID-19 is limited, increasing experimental evidence supports the significant contribution of B and T cells towards the resolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection. Despite the availability of several COVID-19 vaccines with high efficacy, more effective vaccines are still needed to protect against the new variants of SARS-CoV-2. Employing a comprehensive immunoinformatic prediction algorithm and leveraging the genetic closeness with SARS-CoV, we have predicted potential immune epitopes in the structural proteins of SARS-CoV-2. The S and N proteins of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoVs are main targets of antibody detection and have motivated us to design four multi-epitope vaccines which were based on our predicted B- and T-cell epitopes of SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins. The cardinal epitopes selected for the vaccine constructs are predicted to possess antigenic, non-allergenic, and cytokine-inducing properties. Additionally, some of the predicted epitopes have been experimentally validated in published papers. Furthermore, we used the C-ImmSim server to predict effective immune responses induced by the epitope-based vaccines. Taken together, the immune epitopes predicted in this study provide a platform for future experimental validations which may facilitate the development of effective vaccine candidates and epitope-based serological diagnostic assays.",

We identified a role for MSC-EV in immune modulation and cellular salvage in a model of SARS-CoV-2 induced acute lung injury (ALI) using pulmonary epithelial cells and exposure to cytokines or the SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD). Whereas RBD or cytokine exposure caused a pro-inflammatory cellular environment and injurious signaling, impairing alveolar-capillary barrier function, and inducing cell death, MSC-EVs reduced inflammation and reestablished target cell health. Importantly, MSC-EV treatment increased active ACE2 surface protein compared to RBD injury, identifying a previously unknown role for MSC-EV treatment in COVID-19 signaling and pathogenesis. The beneficial effect of MSC-EV treatment was confirmed in an LPS-induced rat model of ALI wherein MSC-EVs reduced pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion and respiratory dysfunction associated with disease. MSC-EV administration was dose-responsive, demonstrating a large effective dose range for clinical translation. These data provide direct evidence of an MSC-EV-mediated improvement in ALI and contribute new insights into the therapeutic potential of MSC-EVs in COVID-19 or similar pathologies of respiratory distress.",

In the case of the COVID-19, several preventive measures were formally enforced by state authorities in the majority of countries worldwide. Thus, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the intertwining of formal and informal social control could be observed. Hence, in this study a cross-sectional design was chosen to explore the issue in Slovenia. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first in the current literature to empirically test the general deterrence theory in pandemic circumstances (as external factors predicting individuals' compliance with the COVID-19 preventive measures). The results suggest an important role of informal punishment, with perceived informal severity being the only statistically significant factor from the general deterrence theory. In contrast to external factors, internal factors play a significantly greater role in promoting people's self-protective behavior in pandemic circumstances. During the unknown, the uncertain and delicate situations with which people have no previous experience, both personal beliefs about the effectiveness of measures and perceived self-efficacy are more important than fear of formal sanctions.",

It included the data of female patients aged 10 to 49 years hospitalized because of severe COVID-19 disease (RT-PCR+ for SARS-CoV-2), from February 17, 2020 to January 02, 2021. They were separated into 3 groups: pregnant, puerperal, and neither pregnant nor puerperal. General comparisons and then adjustments for confounding variables (propensity score matching [PSM]) were made, using demographic and clinical characteristics, disease progression (admission to the intensive care unit [ICU] and invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support), and outcome (cure or death). Deaths were analyzed in each group according to comorbidities, invasive or noninvasive ventilatory support, and admission to the ICU.RESULTS: As many as 40,640 reproductive age women hospitalized for COVID-19 were identified: 3,372 were pregnant, 794 were puerperal, and 36,474 were neither pregnant nor puerperal. Groups were significantly different in terms of demographic data and comorbidities (p<0.0001). Pregnant and puerperal women were less likely to be symptomatic than the women who were neither one nor the other (72.1%, 69.7% and 88.8%, respectively). Pregnant women, however, had a higher frequency of anosmia, and ageusia than the others. After PSM, puerperal women had a worse prognosis than pregnant women with respect to admission to the ICU, invasive ventilatory support, and death, with OR (95% CI) 1.97 (1.55 - 2.50), 2.71 (1.78 - 4.13), and 2.51 (1.79 - 3.52), respectively.CONCLUSION: Puerperal women were at a higher risk for serious outcomes (need for the ICU, need for invasive and noninvasive ventilatory support, and death) than pregnant women.",

However, people of the same age can have very different health statuses. Frailty is a commonly used metric of health and has been found to be more strongly associated with mortality than age among COVID-19 inpatients.METHODS: We compared the number of first vaccine doses administered across the 135 NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups (CCGs) of England to both the over 50 population and the estimated frail population in each area. Area-based frailty estimates were generated using the English Longitudinal Survey of Ageing (ELSA), a national survey of older people. We also compared the number of doses to the number of people with other risk factors associated with COVID-19: atrial fibrillation, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, learning disabilities, obesity and smoking status.RESULTS: We estimate that after 79 days of the vaccine program, across all Clinical Commissioning Group areas, the number of people who received a first vaccine per frail person ranged from 4.4 (95% CI 4.0-4.8) and 20.1 (95% CI 18.3-21.9). The prevalences of other risk factors were also poorly associated with the prevalence of vaccination across England.CONCLUSIONS: Vaccination with age-based priority created area-based inequities in the number of doses administered relative to the number of people who are frail or have other risk factors associated with COVID-19. As frailty has previously been found to be more strongly associated with mortality than age for COVID-19 inpatients, an age-based priority system may increase the risk of mortality in some areas during the vaccine roll-out period. Authorities planning COVID-19 vaccination programmes should consider the disadvantages of an age-based priority system.",

Health professionals including midwives and doctors support and influence vaccination uptake by childbearing women. There is currently no evidence regarding the COVID-19 vaccination perceptions and intentions of those who receive or provide maternity care in Australia. The aim of this study was to address this gap in knowledge and explore the perceptions and intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination from consumers and providers of maternity care in Australia.METHODS: A national cross-sectional online study conducted in early 2021 in Australia, a country that has had a very low number of COVID-19 cases and deaths. Recruitment was undertaken through parenting and health professional social media sites and professional college distribution lists. A total of 853 completed responses, from women (n = 326), maternity care providers including doctors (n = 58), midwives (n = 391) and midwifery students (n = 78).FINDINGS: Personal intention to be vaccinated ranged from 48-89% with doctors most likely and women least likely. Doctors and midwifery students were significantly more likely to recommend the vaccine to pregnant women in their care than midwives (p<0.001). Fewer doctors (2%) felt that women should wait until breastfeeding had concluded before being vaccinated compared with 24% of midwives and 21% of midwifery students (p<0.001). More than half of the midwives (53%) had concerns about the COVID-19 vaccine for the women in their care compared with 35% of doctors and 46% of midwifery students. Despite national guidelines recommending vaccination of breastfeeding women, 54% of practitioners were unlikely to recommend vaccination for this group.CONCLUSION: This is the first study to explore the perceptions and intentions regarding COVID-19 vaccination from the perspective of those who receive and provide maternity care in Australia. Findings have utility to support targeted public health messaging for these and other cohorts.",

The objective of this qualitative assessment was to better understand what individual and facility level factors may have contributed to the impact of COVID-19 on Certified Nursing Assistants (CNAs) and Environmental Services (EVS) staff working in nursing homes.METHODS: Based on a simple random sample from the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), 7,520 facilities were emailed invitations requesting one CNA and/or one EVS staff member for participation in a voluntary focus group over Zoom. Facility characteristics were obtained via NHSN and publicly available sources; participant demographics were collected via SurveyMonkey during registration and polling during focus groups. Qualitative information was coded using NVIVO and Excel.RESULTS: Throughout April 2021, 23 focus groups including 110 participants from 84 facilities were conducted homogenous by participant role. Staffing problems were a recurring theme reported. Participants often cited the toll the pandemic took on their emotional well-being, describing increased stress, responsibilities, and time needed to complete their jobs. The lack of consistent and systematic guidance resulting in frequently changing infection prevention protocols was also reported across focus groups.CONCLUSIONS: Addressing concerns of low wages and lack of financial incentives may have the potential to attract and retain employees to help alleviate nursing home staff shortages. Additionally, access to mental health resources could help nursing home staff cope with the emotional burden of the COVID-19 pandemic. These frontline staff members provided invaluable insight and should be included in improvement efforts to support nursing homes recovering from the impact of COVID-19 as well as future pandemic planning.",

An association between the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs)-specifically fluoxetine hydrochloride and fluvoxamine maleate-with decreased mortality among patients with COVID-19 has been reported in recent studies; however, these studies had limited power due to their small size.Objective: To investigate the association of SSRIs with outcomes in patients with COVID-19 by analyzing electronic health records (EHRs).Design, Setting, and Participants: This retrospective cohort study used propensity score matching by demographic characteristics, comorbidities, and medication indication to compare SSRI-treated patients with matched control patients not treated with SSRIs within a large EHR database representing a diverse population of 83 584 patients diagnosed with COVID-19 from January to September 2020 and with a duration of follow-up of as long as 8 months in 87 health care centers across the US.Exposures: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and specifically (1) fluoxetine, (2) fluoxetine or fluvoxamine, and (3) other SSRIs (ie, not fluoxetine or fluvoxamine).Main Outcomes and Measures: Death.Results: A total of 3401 adult patients with COVID-19 prescribed SSRIs (2033 women [59.8%]; mean [SD] age, 63.8 [18.1] years) were identified, with 470 receiving fluoxetine only (280 women [59.6%]; mean [SD] age, 58.5 [18.1] years), 481 receiving fluoxetine or fluvoxamine (285 women [59.3%]; mean [SD] age, 58.7 [18.0] years), and 2898 receiving other SSRIs (1733 women [59.8%]; mean [SD] age, 64.7 [18.0] years) within a defined time frame. When compared with matched untreated control patients, relative risk (RR) of mortality was reduced among patients prescribed any SSRI (497 of 3401 [14.6%] vs 1130 of 6802 [16.6%]; RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.85-0.99]; adjusted P = .03); fluoxetine (46 of 470 [9.8%] vs 937 of 7050 [13.3%]; RR, 0.72 [95% CI, 0.54-0.97]; adjusted P = .03); and fluoxetine or fluvoxamine (48 of 481 [10.0%] vs 956 of 7215 [13.3%]; RR, 0.74 [95% CI, 0.55-0.99]; adjusted P = .04). The association between receiving any SSRI that is not fluoxetine or fluvoxamine and risk of death was not statistically significant (447 of 2898 [15.4%] vs 1474 of 8694 [17.0%]; RR, 0.92 [95% CI, 0.84-1.00]; adjusted P = .06).Conclusions and Relevance: These results support evidence that SSRIs may be associated with reduced severity of COVID-19 reflected in the reduced RR of mortality. Further research and randomized clinical trials are needed to elucidate the effect of SSRIs generally, or more specifically of fluoxetine and fluvoxamine, on the severity of COVID-19 outcomes.",

Adults (age ?18 years) who had not been diagnosed with COVID-19 were recruited during each period, and their sociodemographic information, symptoms, travel, contact, quarantine, and COVID-19 testing history were collected.Main Outcomes and Measures: The main outcome was prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies were detected by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay based on spike (S1/S2) protein, followed by confirmation with a commercial electrochemiluminescence immunoassay based on the receptor binding domain of spike protein.Results: The study enrolled 4198 participants (2539 [60%] female; median age, 50 years [IQR, 25 years]), including 903 (22%), 1046 (25%), and 2249 (53%) during April 21 to July 7, 2020; during September 29 to November 23, 2020; and during January 15 to April 18, 2021, respectively. The numbers of participants aged 18 to 39 years, 40 to 59 years, and 60 years or older were 1328 (32%), 1645 (39%), and 1225 (29%), respectively. Among the participants, 2444 (58%) stayed in Hong Kong since November 2019 and 2094 (50%) had negative SARS-CoV-2 RNA test results. Only 170 (4%) reported ever having contact with individuals with confirmed cases, and 5% had been isolated or quarantined. Most (2803 [67%]) did not recall any illnesses, whereas 737 (18%), 212 (5%), and 385 (9%) had experienced respiratory symptoms, gastrointestinal symptoms, or both, respectively, before testing. Six participants were confirmed to be positive for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG; the adjusted prevalence of unidentified infection was 0.15% (95% CI, 0.06%-0.32%). Extrapolating these findings to the whole population, there were fewer than 1.9 unidentified infections for every recorded confirmed case. The overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Hong Kong before the roll out of vaccination was less than 0.45%.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cross-sectional study of participants from the general public in Hong Kong, the prevalence of unidentified SARS-CoV-2 infection was low after 3 major waves of the pandemic, suggesting the success of the pandemic mitigation by stringent isolation and quarantine policies even without complete city lockdown. More than 99.5% of the general population of Hong Kong remain naive to SARS-CoV-2, highlighting the urgent need to achieve high vaccine coverage.",

Data were collected from a sample of 135 villages within a densely populated 350-km2 rural area of Bangladesh. Household data were obtained first in person and subsequently over the telephone. For the analysis, mortality data were stratified by month, age, sex, and household education. Mortality rates were modeled by bayesian multilevel regression, and the strata were aggregated to the population by poststratification. Data analysis was performed from February to April 2021.Exposures: Date and cause of any changes in household composition, as well as changes in income and food availability.Main Outcomes and Measures: Mortality rates were compared for 2019 and 2020, both without adjustment and after adjustment for nonresponse and differences in demographic variables between surveys. Income and food availability reported for January, May, and November 2020 were also compared.Results: Enumerators collected data from an initial 16 054 households in January 2020; 14 551 households (91%) responded when contacted again by telephone in May 2020, and 11 933 households (74%)responded when reached again over the telephone in November 2020, for a total of 58 806 individuals (29 726 female participants [50.5%]; mean [SD] age, 26.4 [19.8] years). A total of 276 deaths were reported between February and the end of October 2020 for the subset of the population that could be contacted twice over the telephone, slightly below the 289 deaths reported for the same population over the same period in 2019. After adjustment for survey nonresponse and poststratification, 2020 mortality changed by -8% (95% CI, -21% to 7%) compared with an annualized mortality of 6.1 deaths per 1000 individuals in 2019. However, in May 2020, salaried primary income earners reported a 40% decrease in monthly income (from 17 485 to 10 835 Bangladeshi Taka), and self-employed earners reported a 60% decrease in monthly income (23 083 to 8521 Bangladeshi Taka), with only a small recovery observed by November 2020.Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of households in rural Bangladesh, all-cause mortality was lower in 2020 compared with 2019. Restrictions imposed by the government may have limited the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic in rural areas, although economic data suggest that these restrictions need to be accompanied by expanded welfare programs.",

However, their clinicopathologic and prognostic significances have not been studied in gallbladder cancers. Here, we systematically evaluated the YAP and TEAD4 immunolabelings and their association with clinicopathologic characteristics and survival outcomes using 212 specimens of surgically resected gallbladder cancers. High YAP and TEAD4 immunolabelings were identified in 70 (33%) cases and were associated with infiltrative growth pattern, poor differentiation, perineural invasion, and advanced pT classification and AJCC stage. High YAP immunolabeling was significantly associated with high TEAD4 immunolabeling (p < 0.001). High immunolabeling levels of YAP or TEAD4 alone and the combined YAPhigh TEAD4high group were significantly associated with poor survival in both univariate (p < 0.001) and multivariate analyses (HR = 2.358; 95% CI, 1.369-4.061; p = 0.002). Therefore, the YAP and TEAD4 immunolabelings are associated with aggressive behavior of gallbladder cancers and may be useful as a prognostic indicator in patients with surgically resected gallbladder cancer.",

Assessments were made using the International RLS Rating Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Beck anxiety and depression index and the SF-36 quality of life scores.RESULTS: We found that the frequency of RLS in RA patients was 29.1% and 13.8% in healthy control (p = 0.021). RA patients had 44.4% iron deficiency and 5.5% anemia of chronic disease. We found that 52.3% of patients with iron deficiency had RLS. There was an independent relationship between present of RLS and FSS (Beta [�] = 0.317, p = 0.005) and total iron binding capacity (TIBC) (� = 0.244, p = 0.031). There was an independent relationship between RLS severity score and PSQI (� = 0.264, p = 0.025) and social functionality (� = 0.302, p = 0.009).CONCLUSION: The prevalence of iron deficiency is high in RA in the developing countries. Analysis obtained in patients with RA is suggestive of an association between iron deficiency and increased frequency of RLS. The presence of RLS in patients with RA negatively affects sleep quality, psychiatric status, and quality of life of patients with RA. TIBC value may be a predictive marker for early detection of RLS in patients with RA.",

The ability of the oxime K870 to decrease tabun-induced acute neurotoxicity was slightly higher than that of pralidoxime and similar to the oxime HI-6. These results roughly correspond to the histopathological evaluation of tabun-induced brain damage.CONCLUSION: The newly synthesized oxime K870 is not a suitable replacement for commonly used oximes in the antidotal treatment of acute tabun poisonings because its neuroprotective efficacy is only slightly higher or similar compared to studied currently used oximes.",

Antioxidant enzymes can play an important role in the outcome of CD and may influence postoperative recurrence in these patients. The aim of our study was to evaluate gene expression of intracellular antioxidant enzymes in surgically resected intestinal specimens of patients with CD, both in macroscopically normal and in inflamed tissue.METHODS: A total of 28 patients referred for elective bowel resection were enrolled in the study. Full-thickness small intestinal specimens were investigated. Gene expression of antioxidant enzymes - superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPX), glutathione reductase (GSR) - was evaluated both in macroscopically normal and inflamed samples.RESULTS: There were significantly lower levels of SOD1 mRNA (p = 0.007) and GSR mRNA (p = 0.027) in inflamed tissue compared to macroscopically normal areas. No significant differences were found between affected and non-affected intestinal segments in mRNA for SOD2, SOD3 and GPX.CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot data clearly showed that the gene expression of major antioxidant enzymes is not a uniform mechanism in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease. Topically decreased gene expression of SOD1 and GSR might facilitate the segmental tissue injury caused by reactive oxygen species.",

The main group (n = 18) was formed by children with MUO, according to the recommendations of the expert group of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. The control group (n = 17) was represented by children with MHO. Statistical methods were used: analysis of variance, Wald's sequential analysis, Spearman's correlation analysis, analysis of nominal data and multiple discriminant analysis.RESULTS: 10 types of non-synonymous SNPs (rs3790435, rs1137100, rs2186248, rs70940803, rs79639154, rs1359482195, rs1137101, rs1805094, rs13306520, rs13306522) of the LEPR gene in obese children have been identified. Multiple discriminant analysis demonstrated that the following LEPR SNPs are of greatest importance in the development of MUO: rs3790435, rs13306522, rs13306520. Analysis of nominal data revealed significant differences in the groups for Copy number variation (CNV) rs3790435 of the LEPR gene. Wald's analysis allowed us to identify 6 important predictors of MUO (? ? 0.5): 2 CNV rs3790435 (Relative Risk, RR = 2, Prognostic coefficient, PC = +2.76); male gender of the child (RR = 1.3, PC = +1.35); rs3790435 (RR = 1.9, PC = +2.76); hyperleptinemia more than 40.56 ng/ml (RR = 2, PC = +3); CNV rs1359482195 ? 3 (RR = 1.9, PC = +5.8); SNP of the LEPR gene ?4 (RR = 3.8, PC = +5.8).CONCLUSION: Children with the genotype rs3790435 gene LEPR had signs of MUO more often.",

In some cases, AM can be found accidentally on CT performed due to other reasons or during surgery. Diagnosis consists mainly of imaging methods such as ultrasound, CT, and MRI with the finding of encapsulated cystic mass with calcifications.

In our report, we describe a case of a 42-year-old, previously almost healthy male who developed sensory symptoms 14 days after the first dose of Pfizer vaccine. One week later, the patient developed right facial nerve palsy and lower limb weakness and was no longer able to walk. Albuminocytological dissociation was detected in the cerebrospinal fluid, and there were inflammatory radicular changes in MRI scans of the lumbosacral spine. EMG indicated significant demyelinating polyradiculoneuritis and no antibodies against gangliosides were demonstrated. A 5-day course of immunoglobulins at a dose of 2 g/kg lead to a significant improvement and the patient was soon able to walk.

There are only very few reports concerning ibandronate therapy in children and adolescents, and in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), as bisphosphonates are not registered for therapeutic use in pediatrics.CASE REPORT: We present three patients with OI, where once-monthly oral ibandronate increased spinal BMD after two and four years, respectively, of therapy without any occurrence of new fractures and no adverse reactions. Somatic growth was not affected by the ibandronate treatment.CONCLUSION: Once-monthly oral ibandronate increased BMD and most probably improved bone quality in young patients with OI.",

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is driven by imbalanced immune responses, yet the role of immunometabolism in COVID-19 pathogenesis remains unclear. By investigating 87 patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, 6 critically ill non-COVID-19 patients, and 47 uninfected controls, we found an immunometabolic dysregulation in patients with progressed COVID-19. Specifically, T cells, monocytes, and granulocytes exhibited increased mitochondrial mass, yet only T cells accumulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS), were metabolically quiescent, and showed a disrupted mitochondrial architecture. During recovery, T cell ROS decreased to match the uninfected controls. Transcriptionally, T cells from severe/critical COVID-19 patients showed an induction of ROS-responsive genes as well as genes related to mitochondrial function and the basigin network. Basigin (CD147) ligands cyclophilin A and the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein triggered ROS production in T cells in vitro. In line with this, only PCR-positive patients showed increased ROS levels. Dexamethasone treatment resulted in a downregulation of ROS in vitro and T cells from dexamethasone-treated patients exhibited low ROS and basigin levels. This was reflected by changes in the transcriptional landscape. Our findings provide evidence of an immunometabolic dysregulation in COVID-19 that can be mitigated by dexamethasone treatment.",

Generally, deceased patients demonstrated a gradual increase of neutrophils and IL-6 but a decrease of lymphocytes and platelets after the onset of illness. Specifically, sustained low numbers of CD8+ T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells were noted in deceased patients, while these cells gradually restored in mild and severe patients. Furthermore, deceased patients displayed a rapid increase of HLA-DR expression on CD4+ T cells in the early phase, but with a low level of overall CD45RO and HLA-DR expressions on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. Notably, in the early phase, deceased patients showed a lower level of plasma cells and antigen-specific IgG, but higher expansion of CD16+CD14+ proinflammatory monocytes and HLA-DR-CD14+ monocytic-myeloid-derived suppressor cells (M-MDSCs) than mild or severe patients. Among these immunological parameters, M-MDSCs showed the best performance in predicting COVID-19 mortality, when using a cutoff value of ?10%. Cluster analysis found a typical immunological pattern in deceased patients on day 9 after onset, which was characterized as the increase of inflammatory markers (M-MDSCs, neutrophils, CD16+CD14+ monocytes, and IL-6) but a decrease of host immunity markers.Conclusions: This study systemically characterizes the kinetics of immunity of COVID-19, highlighting the importance of immunity in patient prognosis.",

A systemic hyper-inflammation characterizes severe COVID-19 disease, often associated with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Blood biomarkers capable of risk stratification are of great importance in effective triage and critical care of severe COVID-19 patients. Flow cytometry and next-generation sequencing were done on peripheral blood cells and urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), and cytokines were measured from and mass spectrometry-based proteomics was done on plasma samples from an Indian cohort of COVID-19 patients. Publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing data were analyzed for validation of primary data. Statistical analyses were performed to validate risk stratification. We report here higher plasma abundance of suPAR, expressed by an abnormally expanded myeloid cell population, in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS. The plasma suPAR level was found to be linked to a characteristic plasma proteome, associated with coagulation disorders and complement activation. Receiver operator characteristic curve analysis to predict mortality identified a cutoff value of suPAR at 1,996.809 pg/ml (odds ratio: 2.9286, 95% confidence interval 1.0427-8.2257). Lower-than-cutoff suPAR levels were associated with a differential expression of the immune transcriptome as well as favorable clinical outcomes, in terms of both survival benefit (hazard ratio: 0.3615, 95% confidence interval 0.1433-0.912) and faster disease remission in our patient cohort. Thus, we identified suPAR as a key pathogenic circulating molecule linking systemic hyperinflammation to the hypercoagulable state and stratifying clinical outcomes in severe COVID-19 patients with ARDS.",

To test the hypothesis, we constructed a parsimonious mechanistic mathematical model. After calibration of the model for initial viral load and then by varying a few key parameters, we show that the core model generates four distinct viral load, immune response and associated disease trajectories termed \"patient archetypes\", whose temporal dynamics are reflected in clinical data from hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The model also accounts for responses to corticosteroid therapy and predicts that vaccine-induced neutralizing antibodies and cellular memory will be protective, including from severe COVID-19 disease. This generalizable modeling framework could be used to analyze protective and pathogenic immune responses to diverse viral infections.",

To date, the mechanism of viral immune escape remains unclear, which is a great obstacle to developing effective clinical treatment. RNA processing mechanisms, including alternative polyadenylation (APA) and alternative splicing (AS), are crucial in the regulation of most human genes in many types of infectious diseases. Because the role of APA and AS in response to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection remains unknown, we performed de novo identification of dynamic APA sites using a public dataset of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) RNA-Seq data in COVID-19 patients. We found that genes with APA were enriched in innate immunity -related gene ontology categories such as neutrophil activation, regulation of the MAPK cascade and cytokine production, response to interferon-gamma and the innate immune response. We also reported genome-wide AS events and enriched viral transcription-related categories upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. Interestingly, we found that APA events may give better predictions than AS in COVID-19 patients, suggesting that APA could act as a potential therapeutic target and novel biomarker in those patients. Our study is the first to annotate genes with APA and AS in COVID-19 patients and highlights the roles of APA variation in SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In light of the recent revelation that reinfection by COVID-19 is possible, the proposed model attempt to investigate how reinfection with COVID-19 will alter the future dynamics of the recent unfolding pandemic. Fitting the mathematical model on the Kenya COVID-19 dataset, model parameter values were obtained and used to conduct numerical simulations. Numerical results suggest that reinfection of recovered individuals who have lost their protective immunity will create a large pool of asymptomatic infectious individuals which will ultimately increase symptomatic individuals with mild symptoms and symptomatic individuals with severe symptoms (critically ill) needing urgent medical attention. The model suggests that reinfection with COVID-19 will lead to an increase in cumulative reported deaths. Comparison of the impact of non pharmaceutical interventions on curbing COVID19 proliferation suggests that wearing face masks profoundly reduce COVID-19 prevalence than maintaining social/physical distance. Further, numerical findings reveal that increasing detection rate of asymptomatic cases via contact tracing, testing and isolating them can drastically reduce COVID-19 surge, in particular individuals who are critically ill and require admission into intensive care.",

Participants completed measures reflecting moral distress, perceptions of organizational response to the pandemic, burnout, and symptoms of psychological disorders, including depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD).Results: Structural equation modelling showed that when organizational predictors were considered together, resource adequacy, positive work life impact, and ethical work environment negatively predicted severity of moral distress, whereas COVID-19 risk perception positively predicted severity of moral distress. Moral distress also significantly and positively predicted symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and burnout.Conclusions: Our findings highlight an urgent need for HCW organizations to implement strategies designed to prevent long-term moral and psychological distress within the workplace.

Half the sample (199; 48.5%) completed their 3-month follow-up assessment after the pandemic restrictions began in Jordan and 211 (51.5%) completed the assessment prior to the pandemic. Refugees were independently assessed for symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression at baseline and follow-up, and pandemic-related worries were assessed at follow-up for those who completed their assessment during the pandemic.Results: The most commonly reported worries were economic difficulties (82.4%), shortage of essential supplies (71.3%), and infecting others (59.7%) or themselves (51.9%). Refugees who were assessed during the pandemic had less severe PTSD symptoms than those assessed prior to the pandemic. Significant predictors of pandemic-related worries were lower levels of depression prior to the pandemic and greater anxiety during the pandemic.Conclusion: These findings highlight the specific needs of refugees during the pandemic and suggest that pre-existing mental health issues may not necessarily be the key risk factors for who will experience major mental health issues or worries during the pandemic.",

This study analyzed the clinical features and temporal lung radiographic changes in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 pneumonia who did not require invasive mechanical ventilation during the acute and convalescent periods. MATERIAL AND METHODS The data of 25 patients with COVID-19 pneumonia from January 29, 2020, to November 24, 2020, who did not require invasive mechanical ventilation and who were followed up were retrospectively collected. The 25 patients were divided into severe and moderate groups. Clinical characteristics and computed tomography (CT) manifestations were compared. A total of 121 consecutive thin-slice CT scans were collected at 4 weeks, 2 months, and 5 months after admission to evaluate lung abnormalities in the patients. The CT score was used to assess disease severity. RESULTS The severe group had a lower rate of nucleic acid conversion within 10 days of admission and higher D-dimer, creatine kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase values. In the severe group, hospital stay was longer and hospitalization costs were higher. The average CT score of the severe group peaked in the second week, while the moderate group peaked in the first week and then decreased over time. There were no statistically significant differences in the average CT score between the 2 groups at the 5-month follow-up. CONCLUSIONS The pulmonary lesions of patients recovering from COVID-19 and who do not require invasive mechanical ventilation were gradually absorbed and resolved over time.",

In this respect NETosis is gaining increased attention in the scientific community, as an important pathological process contributing to mortality. We sought to test if indeed there exists robust evidence of NETosis in multiple transcriptomic data sets from human subjects with severe COVID-19 disease. Gene set enrichment analysis was performed to test for up-regulation of gene set functional in NETosis in the blood of patients with COVID-19 illness.RESULTS: Blood gene expression functional in NETosis increased with severity of illness, showed negative correlation with blood oxygen saturation, and was validated in the lung of COVID-19 non-survivors. Temporal expression of IL-6 was compared between severe and moderate illness with COVID-19. Unsupervised clustering was performed to reveal co-expression of IL-6 with complement genes. In severe COVID-19 illness, there is transcriptional evidence of activation of NETosis, complement and coagulation cascade, and negative correlation between NETosis and respiratory function (oxygen saturation). An early spike in IL-6 is observed in severe COVID-19 illness that is correlated with complement activation.CONCLUSIONS: Based on the transcriptional dynamics of IL-6 expression and its downstream effect on complement activation, we constructed a model that links early spike in IL-6 level with persistent and self-perpetuating complement activation, NETosis, immunothrombosis and respiratory dysfunction. Our model supports the early initiation of anti-IL6 therapy in severe COVID-19 disease before the life-threatening complications of the disease can perpetuate themselves autonomously.",

Moreover, using computational approaches, we assess whether these mutations are associated with changes in viral virulence.METHODS: We utilize genetic data from 144 sequences of SARS-CoV-2 strains from the Cypriot population obtained between March 2020 and January 2021, as well as all data available from GISAID. We combine this with countries' regional information, such as deaths and cases per million, as well as COVID-19-related public health austerity measure response times. Initial indications of selective advantage of Cyprus-specific mutations are obtained by mutation tracking analysis. This entails calculating specific mutation frequencies within the Cypriot population and comparing these with their prevalence world-wide throughout the course of the pandemic. We further make use of linear regression models to extrapolate additional information that may be missed through standard statistical analysis.RESULTS: We report a single mutation found in the ORF1ab gene (nucleotide position 18,440) that appears to be significantly enriched within the Cypriot population. The amino acid change is denoted as S6059F, which maps to the SARS-CoV-2 NSP14 protein. We further analyse this mutation using regression models to investigate possible associations with increased deaths and cases per million. Moreover, protein structure prediction tools show that the mutation infers a conformational change to the protein that significantly alters its structure when compared to the reference protein.CONCLUSIONS: Investigating Cyprus-specific mutations for SARS-CoV-2 can lead to a better understanding of viral pathogenicity. Researching these mutations can generate potential links between viral-specific mutations and the unique genomics of the Cypriot population. This can not only lead to important findings from which to battle the pandemic on a national level, but also provide insights into viral virulence worldwide.",

Whether kidney dysfunction causes severe COVID-19, and hence is a target of intervention, or whether it is a symptom, is unclear because conventional observational studies are open to confounding. To obtain unconfounded estimates, we used Mendelian randomization to examine the role of kidney function in severe COVID-19.METHODS: We used genome-wide significant, uncorrelated genetic variants to predict kidney function, in terms of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and then assessed whether people with genetically instrumented higher eGFR or lower UACR, an indication of better kidney function, had a lower risk of severe COVID-19 (8779 cases, 1,001,875 controls), using the largest available cohorts with extensive genotyping. For comprehensiveness, we also examined their role in COVID-19 hospitalization (24,274 cases, 2,061,529 controls) and all COVID-19 (1,12,612 cases, 2,474,079 controls).RESULTS: Genetically instrumented higher eGFR was associated with lower risk of severe COVID-19 (odds ratio (OR) 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.83, 0.98) but not related to COVID-19 hospitalization or infection. Genetically instrumented UACR was not related to COVID-19.CONCLUSIONS: Kidney function appears to be one of the key targets for severe COVID-19 treatment. Use of available medications to improve kidney function, such as antihypertensives, might be beneficial for COVID-19 treatment, with relevance to drug repositioning.",

The aim of this study was to estimate causal effects of lipid-related traits on COVID-19 risk in the European population using a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) approach.METHODS: We used summary statistics from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) that included 441,016 participants from the UK Biobank as the exposure dataset of lipid-related traits and from COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative GWAS meta-analyses of European ancestry as the outcome dataset for COVID-19 susceptibility (32,494 cases and 1,316,207 controls), hospitalization (8316 cases and 1,549,095 controls), and severity (4792 cases and 1,054,664 controls). We performed two-sample MR analyses using the inverse variance weighted (IVW) method. As sensitivity analyses, the MR-Egger regression, weighted median, and weighted mode methods were conducted as were leave-one-out sensitivity analysis, the MR-PRESSO global test, PhenoScanner searches, and IVW multivariable MR analyses. A P value below 0.0055 with Bonferroni correction was considered statistically significant.RESULTS: This MR study suggested that serum apolipoprotein B or LDL-cholesterol levels were not significantly associated with COVID-19 risk. On the other hand, we inferred that higher serum triglyceride levels were suggestively associated with higher risks of COVID-19 susceptibility (odds ratio [OR] per standard deviation increase in lifelong triglyceride levels, 1.065; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.001-1.13; P = 0.045) and hospitalization (OR, 1.174; 95% CI, 1.04-1.33; P = 0.012), and were significantly associated with COVID-19 severity (OR, 1.274; 95% CI, 1.08-1.50; P = 0.004). Sensitivity and bidirectional MR analyses suggested that horizontal pleiotropy and reverse causation were unlikely.CONCLUSIONS: Our MR study indicates a causal effect of higher serum triglyceride levels on a greater risk of COVID-19 severity in the European population using the latest and largest GWAS datasets to date. However, as the underlying mechanisms remain unclear and our study might be still biased due to possible horizontal pleiotropy, further studies are warranted to validate our findings and investigate underlying mechanisms.",

Our goal was to study the role of ROR2 in melanoma.METHODS: Gain and loss-of-function strategies were applied to study the biological function of ROR2 in melanoma. Proliferation assays, flow cytometry, and western blotting were used to evaluate cell proliferation and changes in expression levels of cell-cycle and proliferation markers. The role of ROR2 in tumor growth was assessed in xenotransplantation experiments followed by immunohistochemistry analysis of the tumors. The role of ROR2 in melanoma patients was assessed by analysis of clinical data from the Leeds Melanoma Cohort.RESULTS: Unlike previous findings describing ROR2 as an oncogene in melanoma, we describe that ROR2 prevents tumor growth by inhibiting cell-cycle progression and the proliferation of melanoma cells. The effect of ROR2 is mediated by inhibition of Akt phosphorylation and activity which, in turn, regulates the expression, phosphorylation, and localization of major cell-cycle regulators including cyclins (A, B, D, and E), CDK1, CDK4, RB, p21, and p27. Xenotransplantation experiments demonstrated that ROR2 also reduces proliferation in vivo, resulting in inhibition of tumor growth. In agreement with these findings, a higher ROR2 level favors thin and non-ulcerated primary melanomas with reduced mitotic rate and better prognosis.CONCLUSION: We conclude that the expression of ROR2 slows down the growth of primary tumors and contributes to prolonging melanoma survival. Our results demonstrate that ROR2 has a far more complex role than originally described.",

Herein we describe the effects of a 12-week, home-based, exercise program on overall health and quality of life among quarantined patients with juvenile dermatomyositis (JDM).METHOD: This prospective, quasi-experimental, mixed methods (qualitative and quantitative) study was conducted between July and December 2020, during the most restricted period of�COVID-19 pandemic in Brazil. The home-based exercise program consisted of a 12-week, three-times-a-week, aerobic and strengthening (bodyweight) training program. Qualitative data were systematically evaluated. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQOL) and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) evaluate symptoms of mental health disorder, HRQL, and quality of sleep.FINDINGS: 11 patients (out of 27) met the inclusion criteria (91% female; mean � SD age: 13.5 � 3.2 years). Adherence to the intervention was 72.6%. Barriers to exercise involved poor internet connectivity, excessive weekly sessions, and other commitments. Even though not statistically significant, Self-report SDQ subscales Total Difficulties Score, Emotional Problems Score, and PedsQOL School Functioning Score improved after intervention (- 2.4; 95%confidence interval [CI] -5.1; 0.2, p = 0.06; - 1.0; 95%CI -2.2; 0.2, p = 0.09 and; 11.7; 95%CI -2.5; 25.8, p = 0.09, respectively). Remaining SDQ subscales were not altered. Six themes emerged from patients' and parents' comments (qualitative results). Patients engaged in exercise reported other health-related benefits including increased motivation, concentration and strength.INTERPRETATION: A home-based exercise program was associated with qualitative perceptions of improvements in overall health and HRQL by quarantined adolescents with JDM during COVID-19 pandemic. Lessons from this trial may help developing interventions focused on tackling physical inactivity in JDM.",

Aim of our analysis was to describe the characteristics of the COVID-19 infection course as well as preliminary safety and efficacy of Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine in patients with active GU malignancies.METHODS: Patients were retrospectively identified at nine cancer centers in different regions. Patients were included if COVID-19 was diagnosed by a polymerase chain reaction. Data from additional patients with GU cancers who had no positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test before vaccination and who received two doses of Gam-COVID-Vac (Sputnik V) between 11 February and 31 August 2021 were collected for safety assessment. Anonymized data were collected through an online registry covering demographics, treatments, and outcomes.RESULTS: The Gam-COVID-Vac vaccine was well tolerated; no grade 3-5 toxicities were reported in 112 vaccinated metastatic GU cancer patients. The most common grade 1 adverse events (81%) were injection site reactions (76%), flu-like illness (68%), and asthenia (49%). Five patients experienced grade 2 chills (4.5%) and 3 patients had grade 2 fever (2.7%). With median follow-up of 6.2�months, two COVID-19 cases were confirmed by RT-PCR test in the vaccine group (of 112 participants; 1.8%). Eighty-eight patients with COVID-19 disease were included in the analysis. The average age as of the study enrollment was 66 (range 39-81) and the majority of patients were male with renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Thirty-six patients (41%) had evidence of metastatic disease, of these 22 patients were receiving systemic therapy. More than half of patients required hospitalization. Fifty-four patients (61%) experienced complications. Sixteen patients who developed COVID-19 pneumonia required mechanical ventilator support. Sixteen patients (18%) died in a median of 23.5�days after the date of COVID-19 diagnosis was established. The 3-month survival rate was 82%. Clinical and/or radiographic progression of cancer during COVID-19 infection or the subsequent 3�months was observed in 10 patients (11.4%).CONCLUSION: Patients with GU malignancies are at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19 infection when compared to the general population.

This disease can be asymptomatic or can affect multiple organ systems. Damage induced by the virus is related to dysfunctional activity of the immune system, but the activity of molecules such as C-reactive protein (CRP) as a factor capable of inducing an inflammatory status that may be involved in the severe evolution of the disease, has not been extensively evaluated. A systematic review was performed using the NCBI-PubMed database to find articles related to Covid-19 immunity, inflammatory response, and CRP published from December 2019 to December 2020. High levels of CRP were found in patients with severe evolution of Covid-19 in which several organ systems were affected and in patients who died. CRP activates complement, induces the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and induces apoptosis which, together with the inflammatory status during the disease, can lead to a severe outcome. Several drugs can decrease the level or block the effect of CRP and might be useful in the treatment of Covid-19. From this review it is reasonable to conclude that CRP is a factor that can contribute to severe evolution of Covid-19 and that the use of drugs able to lower CRP levels or block its activity should be evaluated in randomized controlled clinical trials.",

Here, we demonstrated dissemination of vaccine viruses and differences in hen innate, mucosal, cellular and humoral immune responses following vaccination with Massachusetts or 793B strains, administered by DW or oculonasal (ON) routes. Detection of IBV in the Mass-vaccinated groups was greater during early time-points, however, 793B was detected more frequently at later timepoints. Viral RNA loads in the Harderian gland and turbinate tissues were significantly higher for ON-Mass compared to all other vaccinated groups. Lachrymal fluid IgY levels were significantly greater than the control at 14�days post-vaccination (dpv) for both vaccine serotypes, and IgA mRNA levels were significantly greater in ON-vaccinated groups compared to DW-vaccinated groups, demonstrating robust mucosal immune responses. Cell mediated immune gene transcripts (CD8-� and CD8-�) were up-regulated in turbinate and trachea tissues. For both vaccines, dissemination and vaccine virus clearance was slower when given by DW compared to the ON route. For ON administration, both vaccines induced comparable levels of mucosal immunity. The Mass vaccine induced cellular immunity to similar levels regardless of vaccination method. When given either by ON or DW, 793B vaccination induced significantly higher levels of humoral immunity.",

Data were collected using a questionnaire that captured general information about the participants and their attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccination. RESULTS Of the participants, 41.8% answered \"Yes\" when asked if they would take the vaccine once it becomes available, 37.6% answered \"Not sure\", and 20.6% answered \"No\". For patients in favor of vaccination, the main reasons reported were fear of getting sick (77.6%), the desire to contribute to herd immunity (57.8%), and trusting the recommendations of health professionals (57.2%). The main reasons for the patients' vaccination -refusal/indecision were doubts about the results from clinical trials of COVID-19 vaccines (49.1%), concerns about adverse effects (24.5%), and confusion about the various vaccine options (19.8%). The majority of participants (82.4%) stated that recommendation by their oncologist could influence their decision about vaccination. Of the participants who indicated unwillingness (refusal or indecision) to be vaccinated against COVID-19, 65.3% stated that recommendation by their oncologist could influence their decision about vaccination. CONCLUSIONS The findings from the present study showed most patients had refused or were indecisive regarding immunization with COVID-19 vaccine. Increasing physician awareness of this situation may result in higher rates of vaccination.",

It initiates entry into human cells by binding to the�peptidase domain of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2)�receptor via its receptor binding domain of S1 subunit of spike protein (SARS-CoV-2-RBD). Employing neutralizing antibodies to prevent binding between SARS-CoV-2-RBD and ACE2 is an effective COVID-19 therapeutic solution. Previous studies found that CC12.3 is a highly potent neutralizing antibody that was isolated from a SARS-CoV-2 infected patient, and its Fab fragment (Fab CC12.3) bound to SARS-CoV-2-RBD with comparable binding affinity to ACE2. To enhance its binding affinity, we employed computational protein design to redesign all CDRs of Fab CC12.3 and molecular dynamics (MD) to validate their predicted binding affinities by the MM-GBSA method. MD results show that the predicted binding affinities of the three best designed Fabs CC12.3 (CC12.3-D02, CC12.3-D05, and CC12.3-D08) are better than those of Fab CC12.3 and ACE2. Additionally, our results suggest that enhanced binding affinities of CC12.3-D02, CC12.3-D05, and CC12.3-D08 are caused by increased SARS-CoV-2-RBD binding interactions of CDRs L1 and L3. This study redesigned neutralizing antibodies with better predicted binding affinities to SARS-CoV-2-RBD than Fab CC12.3 and ACE2. They are promising candidates as neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV-2.",

The Chenopodiaceae family with more than 1500 species is dispersed worldwide. The Iranian wild spinach (Blitum virgatum L.) is an important traditional medicinal plant used for antiviral diseases such as pneumonia and other respiratory track infections. This plant is a mountainous herb and is growing upper than 3000�m. We performed a mass selection plant breeding program on wild populations of this Iranian wild spinach during 2013-2020. Based on experimental and field characteristics this plant was identified as B. virgatum, |abbaricum|, and related characteristics were prepared with reference to the International Union for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants (UPOV). Mass selection program resulted from an adapted population named as medicinal spinach (MSP) population. To compare the mineral content of the mass-selected population with cultivated spinach (Spinacia oleracea L. |Varamin 88|), both plants were planted in pots and fields under similar conditions. In five leaves stage, plant samples were taken from both leaf and crown sections and used for experimental analysis. Atomic absorption spectroscopy was used to determine the mineral content including iron (Fe), zinc (Z), manganese (Mn), and copper (Cu). Our results showed the selected medicinal spinach population (MSP) with about 509�ppm iron was an important iron-rich population with about 3.5-4 times more than the amount of iron in cultivated spinach in the same conditions. Because iron is an important essential element for blood production, respiration process, energy metabolisms, synthesis of collagen, and some neurotransmitters are needed for proper immune function, so the supply of absorbable adequate iron is very important. The reasons such as the prevalence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which affects the amount of exchangeable oxygen in the lungs and historical local evidences of the use of this plant (MSP) for pneumonia, could open new horizons for focusing on studies related to the use of ancestral human experiences in addition to scientifically modern research.",

Influenza viruses lacking NS1 (�NS1) are under clinical development as live attenuated human influenza virus vaccines and induce potent influenza virus-specific humoral and cellular adaptive immune responses. Attenuation of �NS1 influenza viruses is due to their high IFN inducing properties, that limit their replication in vivo. This study demonstrates that pre-treatment with a �NS1 virus results in an antiviral state which prevents subsequent replication of homologous and heterologous viruses, preventing disease from virus respiratory pathogens, including SARS-CoV-2. Our studies suggest that �NS1 influenza viruses could be used for the prophylaxis of influenza, SARS-CoV-2 and other human respiratory viral infections, and that an influenza virus vaccine based on �NS1 live attenuated viruses would confer broad protection against influenza virus infection from the moment of administration, first by non-specific innate immune induction, followed by specific adaptive immunity.",

We hypothesized that cardiac glycoside drugs might block the binding reaction between ACE2 and the Spike (S) protein, and thus block viral penetration into target cells. To test this hypothesis we developed a biochemical assay for ACE2:Spike binding, and tested cardiac glycosides as inhibitors of binding. Here we report that ouabain, digitoxin, and digoxin, as well as sugar-free derivatives digitoxigenin and digoxigenin, are high-affinity competitive inhibitors of ACE2 binding to the Original [D614] S1 and the �/�/� [D614G] S1 proteins. These drugs also inhibit ACE2 binding to the Original RBD, as well as to RBD proteins containing the � [E484K], Mink [Y453F] and �/�/� [N501Y] mutations. As hypothesized, we also found that ouabain, digitoxin and digoxin blocked penetration by SARS-CoV-2 Spike-pseudotyped virus into human lung cells, and infectivity by native SARS-CoV-2. These data indicate that cardiac glycosides may block viral penetration into the target cell by first inhibiting ACE2:RBD binding. Clinical concentrations of ouabain and digitoxin are relatively safe for short term use for subjects with normal hearts. It has therefore not escaped our attention that these common cardiac medications could be deployed worldwide as inexpensive repurposed drugs for anti-COVID-19 therapy.",

Conditions that might compromise the structure and functionality of the airway epithelium include congenital tracheal anomalies, infection, trauma and post-intubation injuries. Recently, the onset of COVID-19 and its complications in managing respiratory failure further intensified the need for tracheal tissue replacement. Thus far, plenty of naturally derived, synthetic or allogeneic materials have been studied for their applicability in tracheal tissue replacement. However, a reliable tracheal replacement material is missing. Therefore, this study used a tissue engineering approach for constructing tracheal tissue. Human respiratory epithelial cells (RECs) were isolated from nasal turbinate, and the cells were incorporated into a calcium chloride-polymerized human blood plasma to form a human tissue respiratory epithelial construct (HTREC). The quality of HTREC in vitro, focusing on the cellular proliferation, differentiation and distribution of the RECs, was examined using histological, gene expression and immunocytochemical analysis. Histological analysis showed a homogenous distribution of RECs within the HTREC, with increased proliferation of the residing RECs within 4 days of investigation. Gene expression analysis revealed a significant increase (p < 0.05) in gene expression level of proliferative and respiratory epithelial-specific markers Ki67 and MUC5B, respectively, within 4 days of investigation. Immunohistochemical analysis also confirmed the expression of Ki67 and MUC5AC markers in residing RECs within the HTREC. The findings show that calcium chloride-polymerized human blood plasma is a suitable material, which supports viability, proliferation and mucin secreting phenotype of RECs, and this suggests that HTREC can be a potential candidate for respiratory epithelial tissue reconstruction.",

Fraction 5 showed the highest inhibitory activity against the SARS-CoV-2 PLpro (IC50 of 0.125 �g mL-1). The untargeted characterization revealed that (-)-epicatechin-3-gallate (ECG) was the most abundant compound in the fraction and the primary molecule absorbed by differentiated Caco-2 cells. Results indicated that fraction 5 was approximately 10 times more active than ECG (IC50 value equal to 11.62 � 0.47 �g mL-1) to inhibit the PLpro target.

Crude and adjusted risk ratios (RR) of an asthma diagnosis were estimated for several parameterizations of blood lead exposure including lifetime average (6 to 48 months) and infancy average (6 to 24 months) concentrations. After adjustment for child sex, birthweight, daycare attendance, maternal race, education, parity, breastfeeding, income, and household smoking, age-specific or composite measures of blood lead were not associated with asthma diagnosis by 72 months of age in this cohort.",

Thus far, no studies have explored the factors associated with increased levels of worry in this population globally. The current study sought to assess the frequency and sources of worry during the COVID-19 pandemic in an international sample of pregnant and postpartum women.METHODS: We conducted an anonymous, online, cross-sectional survey in 64 countries between May and June 2020. The survey was available in 12 languages and hosted on the Pregistry platform for COVID-19 studies. Participants were sought mainly on social media platforms and online parenting forums. The survey included questions related to demographics, level of worry, support, stress, COVID-19 exposure, frequency of media usage, and mental health indicators.RESULTS: The study included 7561 participants. Eighty-three percent of all participants indicated that they were either 'somewhat' or 'very' worried. Women 13-28 weeks pregnant were significantly more likely to indicate that they were 'very worried' compared to those who were postpartum or at other stages of pregnancy. When compared with women living in Europe, those in Africa, Asia and Pacific, North America and South/Latin America were more likely to have increased levels of worry, as were those who more frequently interacted with social media. Different forms of support and stress also had an impact upon level of worry, while indicators of stress and anxiety were positively associated with worry level.CONCLUSION: Pregnant and postpartum women are vulnerable to the changes in societal norms brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Understanding the factors associated with levels of worry within this population will enable society to address potential unmet needs and improve the current and future mental health of parents and children.",

Recent studies suggest an unexpected and unprecedented decrease in preterm births during the initial COVID-19 lockdowns in the first half of 2020. The objective of the current study was to assess the effects of the two months of the initial national COVID-19 lockdown period on the incidence of very and extremely preterm birth in the Netherlands, stratified by either spontaneous or iatrogenic onset of delivery, in both singleton and multiple pregnancies.METHODS: Retrospective cohort study using data from all 10 perinatal centers in the Netherlands on very and extremely preterm births during the initial COVID-19 lockdown from March 15 to May 15, 2020. Incidences of very and extremely preterm birth were calculated using an estimate of the total number of births in the Netherlands in this period. As reference, we used data from the corresponding calendar period in 2015-2018 from the national perinatal registry (Perined). We differentiated between spontaneous versus iatrogenic onset of delivery and between singleton versus multiple pregnancies.RESULTS: The incidence of total preterm birth < 32 weeks in singleton pregnancies was 6.1‰ in the study period in 2020 versus 6.5‰ in the corresponding period in 2015-2018. The decrease in preterm births in singletons was solely due to a significant decrease in iatrogenic preterm births, both < 32 weeks (OR 0.71; 95%CI 0.53 to 0.95) and < 28 weeks (OR 0.53; 95%CI 0.29 to 0.97). For multiple pregnancies, an increase in preterm births < 28 weeks was observed (OR 2.43; 95%CI 1.35 to 4.39).CONCLUSION: This study shows a decrease in iatrogenic preterm births during the initial COVID-19-related lockdown in the Netherlands in singletons. Future studies should focus on the mechanism of action of lockdown measures and reduction of preterm birth and the effects of perinatal outcome.",

This included one antenatal and one postnatal session, each with three evidence-based components: i) support from a non-professional peer to enable a woman to identify her needs; ii) information about local community services and signposting; and iii) development of a personalised If-Then plan to access that support. The aims were to evaluate the intervention and research methods for feasibility and acceptability for perinatal women, maternity care providers and peers, and provide preliminary effectiveness indications.METHODS: Pregnant women living in an area of high deprivation were recruited from community-based antenatal clinics and randomised to intervention or control condition (a booklet about local resources). Outcome measures included women's use of community services by 34 + weeks gestation and 6�months postnatally; mental health and wellbeing measures, and plan implementation. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with women participants, providers, and peers. Data were analysed using framework analysis. Recruitment and retention of peers and participants, intervention fidelity, and acceptability of outcome measures were recorded.RESULTS: Peer facilitators could be recruited, trained, retained and provide the intervention with fidelity. One hundred twenty six women were recruited and randomised, 85% lived in the 1% most deprived UK areas. Recruitment constituted 39% of those eligible, improving to 54% after midwifery liaison. Sixty five percent were retained at 6�months postnatally. Women welcomed the intervention, and found it helpful to plan access to community services. Providers strongly supported the intervention philosophy and integrated this easily into services. The study was not powered to detect significant group differences but there were positive trends in community service use, particularly postnatally. No differences were evident in mental health and wellbeing.CONCLUSIONS: This intervention was well received and easily integrated into existing services. Women living in highly deprived areas could be recruited, randomised and retained. Measures were acceptable. Peer facilitators were successfully trained and retained. Full effectiveness studies are warranted.",

The main aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of fermentation technology on improving the quality of HTRs, and focus on the fermented HTR-induced alleviation of summer heat stress in fattening cattle.RESULTS: In this study, the waste HTR was fermented and then fed to a total of 45 fattening cattle that were divided into 3 groups (fermented HTR replaced 0, 15, 30% of the forage component of the diet), and the feeding experiment was lasted for 40 days. The physiological indexes, growth performance and fecal microbiota of fattening cattle were evaluated and results showed that fermented HTR could effectively reduce the respiratory rate and rectal temperature of fattening cattle under heat stress, increase the daily feed intake and daily gain, and improve the antioxidant content and blood immune index. In addition, we studied the fecal microbiota composition of 6 fattening cattle in control and 30% HTR substitution groups and found fermented HTR significantly changed the composition of fecal microbiota and increased microbial diversity, and correlation analysis suggested that the bacteria were closely related to fecal SCFA levels of fattening cattle under heat stress.CONCLUSIONS: In this study, fermented HTR replaced 30% of the forage component of the diet that can change the intestine microorganisms, maintain health and alleviate the heat stress of fattening cattle.",

Five flavonoid aglycones were isolated and identified from the hydrolyzed aqueous methanol extracts of Anastatica hierochuntica L., Citrus reticulata Blanco, and Kickxia aegyptiaca (L.) Nabelek. They were identified as taxifolin (1), pectolinarigenin (2), tangeretin (3), gardenin B (4), and hispidulin (5). These structures were elucidated based on chromatographic and spectral analysis. In this study, molecular docking studies were carried out for the isolated and identified compounds against SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) compared to the co-crystallized inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 Mpro (�-ketoamide inhibitor (KI), IC50 = 66.72 �g/mL) as a reference standard. Moreover, in vitro screening against SARS-CoV-2 was evaluated. Compounds 2 and 3 showed the highest virus inhibition with IC50 12.4 and 2.5 �g/mL, respectively. Our findings recommend further advanced in vitro and in vivo studies of the examined isolated flavonoids, especially pectolinarigenin (2), tangeretin (3), and gardenin B (4), either alone or in combination with each other to identify a promising lead to target SARS-CoV-2 effectively.

The pharmacokinetic profiling study was conducted according to the four principles of the Lipinski rules and excluded derivative 31. Furthermore, ADMET and toxicity studies showed that derivatives 28, 34, and 47 have the potential to be drugs and have been demonstrated as safe when assessed via seven toxicity models. Finally, comparing the molecular orbital energies and the molecular electrostatic potential maps of 28, 34, and 47 against the co-crystallized ligand in a DFT study indicated that 28 is the most promising candidate to interact with the target receptor (PLpro).",

In order to address the need for a straightforward detection of SARS-CoV-2 infection and assessment of viral spread, we developed rapid, sensitive, extraction-free one-step reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) tests for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in saliva. We analyzed over 700 matched pairs of saliva and nasopharyngeal swab (NSB) specimens from asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. Saliva, as either an oral cavity swab or passive drool, was collected in an RNA stabilization buffer. The stabilized saliva specimens were heat-treated and directly analyzed without RNA extraction. The diagnostic sensitivity of saliva-based RT-qPCR was at least 95% in individuals with subclinical infection and outperformed RT-LAMP, which had at least 70% sensitivity when compared to NSBs analyzed with a clinical RT-qPCR test. The diagnostic sensitivity for passive drool saliva was higher than that of oral cavity swab specimens (95% and 87%, respectively). A rapid, sensitive one-step extraction-free RT-qPCR test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 in passive drool saliva is operationally simple and can be easily implemented using existing testing sites, thus allowing high-throughput, rapid, and repeated testing of large populations. Furthermore, saliva testing is adequate to detect individuals in an asymptomatic screening program and can help improve voluntary screening compliance for those individuals averse to various forms of nasal collections.",

Cytochrome P450 enzymes (CYP450) and their primary redox molecular companion NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR) play a key role in ginsenoside biosynthesis pathway. However, systematic studies of CPR genes in ginseng have not been reported. Numerous studies on ginsenoside synthesis biology still use Arabidopsis CPR (AtCPR1) as a reductase. In this study, we isolated two CPR genes (PgCPR1, PgCPR2) from ginseng adventitious roots. Phylogenetic tree analysis showed that both PgCPR1 and PgCPR2 are grouped in class? of dicotyledonous CPR. Enzyme experiments showed that recombinant proteins PgCPR1, PgCPR2 and AtCPR1 can reduce cytochrome c and ferricyanide with NADPH as the electron donor, and PgCPR1 had the highest enzymatic activities. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis showed that PgCPR1 and PgCPR2 transcripts were detected in all examined tissues of Panax ginseng and both showed higher expression in stem and main root. Expression levels of the PgCPR1 and PgCPR2s were both induced after a methyl jasmonate (MeJA) treatment and its pattern matched with ginsenoside accumulation. The present investigation suggested PgCPR1 and PgCPR2 are associated with the biosynthesis of ginsenoside. This report will assist in future CPR family studies and ultimately improving ginsenoside production through transgenic engineering and synthetic biology.",

Ginsenoside Re was the major pharmacologic ingredient found abundantly in ginseng. However, the anti-diabetic of Ginsenoside Re and its underlying mechanism in metabolic level are still unclear. Serum and urine metabolomic method was carried out to investigate the anti-diabetic pharmacological effects and the potential mechanism of Ginsenoside Re on high-fat diet combined streptozotocin-induced type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) rats based on ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole exactive orbitrap mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-Exactive Orbitrap/MS). Serum and urine samples were collected from the control group (CON), T2DM group, metformin (MET) treatment group, and ginsenoside Re treatment group after intervention. The biochemical parameters of serum were firstly analyzed. The endogenous metabolites in serum and urine were detected by UHPLC-MS. The potential metabolites were screened by multivariate statistical analysis and identified by accurate mass measurement, MS/MS, and metabolite databases. The anti-diabetic-related metabolites were analyzed by KEGG metabolic pathway, and its potential mechanism was discussed. The treatment of ginsenoside Re significantly reduced the blood glucose and serum lipid level improved the oxidative stress caused by T2DM. Biochemical parameters (urea nitrogen, uric acid) showed that ginsenoside Re could improve renal function in T2DM rats. Respective 2 and 6 differential metabolites were found and identified in serum and urine of ginsenoside Re compared with T2DM group and enriched in KEGG pathway. Metabolic pathways analysis indicated that the differential metabolites related to T2DM were mainly involved in arachidonic acid metabolism, Vitamin B6, steroid hormone biosynthesis, and bile secretion metabolic pathways. This study verified the anti-diabetic and anti-oxidation effects of ginsenoside Re, elaborated that ginsenoside Re has a good regulation of the metabolic disorder in T2DM rats, which could promote insulin secretion, stimulated cannabinoid type 1 receptor (CB1), and CaMKK � to activate AMPK signaling pathway, inhibited insulin resistance, and improved blood glucose uptake and diabetic nephropathy, so as to play the role of anti-diabetic.",

In the present study, a series of syn and anti isomers of N-substituted indole-3-carbaldehyde oxime derivatives was synthesized via Schiff base reaction of appropriate carbaldehyde derivatives with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. The in vitro urease inhibitory activities of those derivatives were evaluated against that of Macrotyloma uniflorum urease using the modified Berthelot reaction.

Therefore, we used lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in RAW264.7 macrophages to investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie the anti-inflammatory activities of a methanol extract of Caragana rosea (Cr-ME). We showed that Cr-ME reduced the production of nitric oxide (NO) and mRNA levels of iNOS, TNF-�, and IL-6 in a concentration-dependent manner. We also found that Cr-ME blocked MyD88- and TBK1-induced NF-�B and IRF3 promoter activity, suggesting that it affects multiple targets. Moreover, Cr-ME reduced the phosphorylation levels of I�B�, IKK�/� and IRF3 in a time-dependent manner and regulated the upstream NF-�B proteins Syk and Src, and the IRF3 protein TBK1. Upon overexpression of Src and TBK1, Cr-ME stimulation attenuated the phosphorylation of the NF-�B subunits p50 and p65 and IRF3 signaling. Together, our results suggest that the anti-inflammatory activity of Cr-ME occurs by inhibiting the NF-�B and IRF3 signaling pathways.",

The activity of Family 1 uracil-DNA glycosylase (UNG) activity limits the efficiency of antimetabolite drugs and is essential for virulence in some bacterial and viral infections. Thus, UNG is regarded as a promising target for antitumor, antiviral, antibacterial, and antiprotozoal drugs. Most UNG inhibitors presently developed are based on the uracil base linked to various substituents, yet new pharmacophores are wanted to target a wide range of UNGs. We have conducted virtual screening of a 1,027,767-ligand library and biochemically screened the best hits for the inhibitory activity against human and vaccinia virus UNG enzymes. Although even the best inhibitors had IC50 ? 100 �M, they were highly enriched in a common fragment, tetrahydro-2,4,6-trioxopyrimidinylidene (PyO3). In silico, PyO3 preferably docked into the enzyme's active site, and in kinetic experiments, the inhibition was better consistent with the competitive mechanism. The toxicity of two best inhibitors for human cells was independent of the presence of methotrexate, which is consistent with the hypothesis that dUMP in genomic DNA is less toxic for the cell than strand breaks arising from the massive removal of uracil. We conclude that PyO3 may be a novel pharmacophore with the potential for development into UNG-targeting agents.",

Virtual screening (VS) is a computational procedure that measures the similarity of molecules as one of its primary tasks. Many techniques for capturing the biological similarity between a test compound and a known target ligand have been established in ligand-based virtual screens (LBVSs). However, despite the good performances of the above methods compared to their predecessors, especially when dealing with molecules that have structurally homogenous active elements, they are not satisfied when dealing with molecules that are structurally heterogeneous. The main aim of this study is to improve the performance of similarity searching, especially with molecules that are structurally heterogeneous. The Siamese network will be used due to its capability to deal with complicated data samples in many fields. The Siamese multi-layer perceptron architecture will be enhanced by using two similarity distance layers with one fused layer, then multiple layers will be added after the fusion layer, and then the nodes of the model that contribute less or nothing during inference according to their signal-to-noise ratio values will be pruned. Several benchmark datasets will be used, which are: the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR-DS1, MDDR-DS2, and MDDR-DS3), the Maximum Unbiased Validation (MUV), and the Directory of Useful Decoys (DUD). The results show the outperformance of the proposed method on standard Tanimoto coefficient (TAN) and other methods. Additionally, it is possible to reduce the number of nodes in the Siamese multilayer perceptron model while still keeping the effectiveness of recall on the same level.",

The development of hormonal resistance is caused either by an irreversible block of hormonal signalling (suppression of the activity or synthesis of hormone receptors), or by activation of oestrogen-independent signalling pathways. Recently the effect of exosome-mediated intercellular transfer of hormonal resistance was revealed, however, the molecular mechanism of this effect is still unknown. Here, the role of exosomal miRNAs (microRNAs) in the transferring of hormonal resistance in breast cancer cells has been studied. The methods used in the work include extraction, purification and RNAseq of miRNAs, transfection of miRNA mimetics, immunoblotting, reporter analysis and the MTT test. Using MCF7 breast cancer cells and MCF7/T tamoxifen-resistant sub-line, we have found that some miRNAs, suppressors of oestrogen receptor signalling, are overexpressed in the exosomes of the resistant breast cancer cells. The multiple (but not single) transfection of one of the identified miRNA, miR-181a-2, into oestrogen-dependent MCF7 cells induced the irreversible tamoxifen resistance associated with the continuous block of the oestrogen receptor signalling and the activation of PI3K/Akt pathway. We suppose that the miRNAs-ER� suppressors may act as trigger agents inducing the block of oestrogen receptor signalling and breast cancer cell transition to an aggressive oestrogen-independent state.",

This new attention of the medical community on Remdesivir prompts the medicinal chemists to investigate once again C-nucleosides. One of the essential building blocks to synthetize these compounds is the D-(+)-ribono-1,4-lactone, but some mechanistic aspects linked to the use of different carbohydrate protecting groups remain unclear. Here, we present our investigations on the use of benzylidene as a ribonolactone protecting group useful in the synthesis of C-purine nucleosides analogues. A detailed 1D and 2D NMR structural study of the obtained compounds under different reaction conditions is presented. In addition, a molecular modeling study at the B3LYP/6-31G* level of theory with the SM8 solvation model for CHCl3 and DMSO to support the obtained results is used.

In the last years, it represents one of the most frequent consequences of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). The pathogenesis of DIC is complex, with cross-talk between the coagulant and inflammatory pathways. The objective of this study is to investigate the anti-inflammatory action of ultramicronized palmitoylethanolamide (um-PEA) in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced DIC model in rats. Experimental DIC was induced by continual infusion of LPS (30 mg/kg) for 4 h through the tail vein. Um-PEA (30 mg/kg) was given orally 30 min before and 1 h after the start of intravenous infusion of LPS. Results showed that um-PEA reduced alteration of coagulation markers, as well as proinflammatory cytokine release in plasma and lung samples, induced by LPS infusion. Furthermore, um-PEA also has the effect of preventing the formation of fibrin deposition and lung damage. Moreover, um-PEA was able to reduce the number of mast cells (MCs) and the release of its serine proteases, which are also necessary for SARS-CoV-2 infection. These results suggest that um-PEA could be considered as a potential therapeutic approach in the management of DIC and in clinical implications associated to coagulopathy and lung dysfunction, such as COVID-19.",

A variety of mechanisms may underlie the observed gender-related disparities including differences in sex hormones. However, the precise mechanisms by which female sex hormones may provide protection against SARS-CoV-2 infectivity remains unknown. Here we report new insights into the molecular basis of the interactions between the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein and the human ACE2 receptor. We further report that glycosylation of the ACE2 receptor enhances SARS-CoV-2 infectivity. Importantly, estrogens can disrupt glycan-glycan interactions and glycan-protein interactions between the human ACE2 and the SARS-CoV-2 thereby blocking its entry into cells. In a mouse model of COVID-19, estrogens reduced ACE2 glycosylation and thereby alveolar uptake of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. These results shed light on a putative mechanism whereby female sex hormones may provide protection from developing severe infection and could inform the development of future therapies against COVID-19.",

Here, we used state-of-the-art multiplexed immunostaining of human brains (n = 6 COVID-19, median age = 69.5 years; n = 7 control, median age = 68 years) and demonstrated that expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 is restricted to a subset of neurovascular pericytes. Strikingly, neurological symptoms were exclusive to, and ubiquitous in, patients that exhibited moderate to high ACE2 expression in perivascular cells. Viral dsRNA was identified in the vascular wall and paralleled by perivascular inflammation, as signified by T cell and macrophage infiltration. Furthermore, fibrinogen leakage indicated compromised integrity of the blood-brain barrier. Notably, cerebrospinal fluid from additional 16 individuals (n = 8 COVID-19, median age = 67 years; n = 8 control, median age = 69.5 years) exhibited significantly lower levels of the pericyte marker PDGFR� in SARS-CoV-2-infected cases, indicative of disrupted pericyte homeostasis. We conclude that pericyte infection by SARS-CoV-2 underlies virus entry into the privileged central nervous system space, as well as neurological symptomatology due to perivascular inflammation and a locally compromised blood-brain barrier.",

Despite some controversies, numerous studies have reported a significant association between the use of ACE inhibitors and reduced risk of COVID-19. In our previous studies, we produced and identified peptide sequences present in whey hydrolysates exhibiting high ACE inhibitory activity. Therefore, the aim of this work is to obtain an improved understanding of the function of these natural peptides as RAS inhibitors and investigate their potential therapeutic role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The molecular interactions between peptides IPP, LIVTQ, IIAE, LVYPFP, and human ACE2 were assessed by employing a molecular docking approach. The results show that natural whey-derived peptides have a dual inhibitory action against both ACE and ACE2. This dual activity distinguishes these ACE inhibitory peptides from synthetic drugs, such as Captopril and Lisinopril which were not shown to inhibit ACE2 activity, and may represent a potential strategy in the treatment of COVID-19.",

To discover hit compounds that can be used alone or in combination with repositioned drugs, we first analyzed the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of natural products from Brazil's semiarid region. After, we analyzed the site prediction and druggability of the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro), followed by docking and molecular dynamics simulation. The best SARS-CoV-2 Mpro complexes revealed that other sites were accessed, confirming that our approach could be employed as a suitable starting protocol for ligand prioritization, reinforcing the importance of catalytic cysteine-histidine residues and providing new structural data that could increase the antiviral development mainly against SARS-CoV-2.

Because single target inhibition might not be sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication, multi enzymatic-based therapies may provide a better strategy. Here we present a structural and biochemical characterization of the binding mode of MG-132 to both the main protease of SARS-CoV-2, and to the human Cathepsin-L, suggesting thus an interesting scaffold for the development of double-inhibitors. X-ray diffraction data show that MG-132 well fits into the Mpro active site, forming a covalent bond with Cys145 independently from reducing agents and crystallization conditions. Docking of MG-132 into Cathepsin-L well-matches with a covalent binding to the catalytic cysteine. Accordingly, MG-132 inhibits Cathepsin-L with nanomolar potency and reversibly inhibits Mpro with micromolar potency, but with a prolonged residency time. We compared the apo and MG-132-inhibited structures of Mpro solved in different space groups and we identified a new apo structure that features several similarities with the inhibited ones, offering interesting perspectives for future drug design and in silico efforts.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the transcriptional changes induced by SARS-CoV-2 exposure in pediatric MSCs derived from pediatric lung (MSCs-lung) and CPAM tissues (MSCs-CPAM) in order to elucidate potential pathways involved in SARS-CoV-2 infection in a condition of exacerbated inflammatory response. MSCs-lung and MSCs-CPAM do not express angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TRMPSS2). SARS-CoV-2 appears to be unable to replicate in MSCs-CPAM and MSCs-lung. MSCs-lung and MSCs-CPAM maintained the expression of stemness markers MSCs-lung show an inflammatory response (IL6, IL1B, CXCL8, and CXCL10), and the activation of Notch3 non-canonical pathway; this route appears silent in MSCs-CPAM, and cytokine genes expression is reduced. Decreased value of p21 in MSCs-lung suggested no cell cycle block, and cells did not undergo apoptosis. MSCs-lung appears to increase genes associated with immunomodulatory function but could contribute to inflammation, while MSCs-CPAM keeps stable or reduce the immunomodulatory receptors expression, but they also reduce their cytokines expression. These data indicated that, independently from their perilesional or cystic origin, the MSCs populations already present in a patient affected with CPAM are not permissive for SARS-CoV-2 entry, and they will not spread the disease in case of infection. Moreover, these MSCs will not undergo apoptosis when they come in contact with SARS-CoV-2; on the contrary, they maintain their staminality profile.",

The enzymatic product of cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (CH25H), 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25-HC), was reported to have potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity. Here, we found that the combination of 25-HC with EK1 peptide, a pan-coronavirus (CoV) fusion inhibitor, showed a synergistic antiviral activity. We then used the method of 25-HC modification to design and synthesize a series of 25-HC-modified peptides and found that a 25-HC-modified EK1 peptide (EK1P4HC) was highly effective against infections caused by SARS-CoV-2, its variants of concern (VOCs), and other human CoVs, such as HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E. EK1P4HC could protect newborn mice from lethal HCoV-OC43 infection, suggesting that conjugation of 25-HC with a peptide-based viral inhibitor was a feasible and universal strategy to improve its antiviral activity.",

This study was carried out to identify the expression profile of circular RNA (circRNA) in human DKD and explore circRNA regulatory function in glomeruli and tubuli simultaneously. As a result, a total of 40 upregulated and 23 downregulated differentially expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) were detected. Six candidate DEcircRNAs were verified by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in high glucose-treated human mesangial cells and human proximal renal tubular epithelial cells, respectively. Gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis revealed that both in glomeruli and in tubuli the DEcircRNAs-targeted genes participated in many pathophysiological processes of DKD. Correlation analysis with renal function showed that expression level of DEcircRNA-targeted hub gene was related to renal function. In conclusion, this is the first study to report expression profiles of circRNAs in kidney of DKD patients, and further analysis demonstrated that circRNA probably played a significant regulatory role, providing help for understanding the pathogenesis of DKD and investigating novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategy.",

The study's purpose is to find biomarkers of tumor metastasis by proteomics and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and to design related experiments to study its role in the progress and metastasis of PCa. Method: We analyzed serum from primary PCa stage and metastatic stage of 12 patients to find metastatic PCa serum protein biomarkers using isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ). An effective diagnostic model based on validated biomarkers using logistic regression was established. In vivo and in vitro biological behavior experiments (wound healing, CCK8, and Transwell tests) were carried out after obtaining the biomarkers. Related mechanism has been studied, which may be associated with metastatic PCa. Result: Actin gamma 1 (ACTG1) is a potential biomarker in the metastasis of PCa. Bioinformatics and related experiments show that ACTG1 is high-expressed in PCa tissues and cells. In vivo and in vitro experiments illustrated that the ability of proliferation, migration, and invasion of PCa cells was significantly inhibited after the knockdown of ACTG1 expression. Surprisingly, ERK protein expression was downregulated after ACTG1 knockdown. At the same time, the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition-related markers in PCa cells decrease after treated with ERK1/2 inhibitor, which indicating that ACTG1 may affect the metastatic ability of PCa cells through MAPK/ERK signaling pathway. Conclusion: ACTG1 is a marker of metastasis PCa. It mediates cell proliferation and may regulate the metastasis of PCa through MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, which provides a useful theoretical basis for exploring the treatment of PCa.",

Chemotherapy resistance usually occurs, leading to cancer relapse and poor survival of GC patients. To investigate the role of miRNAs in chemotherapy resistance for GC patients, we conducted an integrated analysis of miRNA expression and survival information using data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas project. Genome-wide screening of chemotherapy response-specific miRNAs was performed using Cox proportional hazards regression analyses for patients who received chemotherapy or those who had never received chemotherapy, respectively. A four-miRNA expression signature (involving two protective miRNAs, miR-200b and miR-103a, and two risk ones miR-199 and miR-152) was predicted as a specific indicator for GC chemoresistance (p = 0.00053; hazard ratio = 8.63), outperforming those clinicopathological factors. Functional experiments confirmed the roles of these signature miRNAs in regulation of chemotherapy response. Functional enrichment of these signature miRNAs and risk score revealed positive association with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and negative association with cell cycle checkpoint and DNA damage response. Furthermore, the immune infiltration-miRNA functional network analysis revealed transformation from activated effector cells to resting immunosuppressive cells are preferred in GCs with adverse chemotherapy response. In summary, our work identifies a four-miRNA expression signature as a promising chemoresistance biomarker in GC, which provides novel insights into developing new strategies to overcome GC chemoresistance.",

However, the role and underlying mechanism of MP in sepsis remain vague. MP inhibited the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-�) and interleukin (IL)-17 and suppressed cell growth in alveolar type II epithelial cells (ATII cells). Small nucleolar RNA host gene 5 (SNHG5) expression was inhibited by LPS and restored by MP. Upregulation of SNHG5 inhibited the cellular role of LPS in ATII cells, and further, downregulation of SNHG5 inhibited the cellular role of MP in ATII cells under LPS conditions. SNHG5 elevated the expression of Copine 1 (CPNE1) by enhancing the mRNA stability of CPNE1. Increasing CPNE1 expression restored the silenced SNHG5-induced inhibitor role of MP in ATII cells under LPS conditions. Finally, MP attenuated lung injury and TNF-� and IL-17 secretion in an LPS-induced sepsis mouse model. Overall, this study investigated the mechanism underlying the effect of MP treatment in sepsis and, for the first time, revealed the important role of the SNHG5/CPNE1 pathway in the development and treatment of sepsis and the potential to serve as a diagnostic and therapeutic target for sepsis.",

Wide-type Huh7 and Hep3B and induced sorafenib-resistant (SR) Huh7/SR and Hep3B/SR cells were used as in vitro cell models. Immunofluorescent staining and coimmunoprecipitation were performed to check protein-protein interaction. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8), terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling (TUNEL), PI/Annexin V staining, and western blot analysis were performed to assess cell response to sorafenib. The results showed that CCDC34 upregulation in HCC was associated with poor survival. Huh7/SR and Hep3B/SR cells had significantly higher CCDC34 expression than the parental cell lines. RABL2A expression was significantly upregulated in SR HCC cells and interacted with CCDC34 in its GTP-bound state in Huh7/SR and Hep3B/SR cells. RABL2A depletion sensitized Huh7/SR and Hep3B/SR cells to sorafenib. RABL2A Q80L mutant (GTP-bound state locked), but not S35N mutant (GDP-bound state locked) overexpression increased sorafenib IC50 of Huh7 and Hep3B cells. CCDC34 depletion nearly abrogated the protective effects of RABL2A Q80L overexpression both in vitro and in vivo. RABL2A Q80L overexpression significantly increased the expression of p-p38 and p-JNK, the effects of which were significantly attenuated by CCDC34 depletion. In summary, we infer that the RABL2A-CCDC34 axis plays an important role in mediating p38/MAPK and JNK/MAPK signaling, thereby contributing to acquired sorafenib resistance in HCC.",

We investigated the changes in and the effects of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) on exercise capacity and immunology six months after COVID-19 hospitalization.METHODS: This retrospective cohort reviewed 233 COVID-19 patients admitted from 17 January 2020 to 29 February 2020. Ninety-eight patients who completed 2-week and 6-month follow-ups and tests were included. Among 98 patients, 27 completed at least five sessions of PR at the First Hospital of Changsha, China, during the 6-month convalescence were allocated to the PR group; the reminder who had not performed any PR were assigned to the control group. The primary outcome was the change in six-minute walk distance (6-MWD) between the 2-week and 6-month follow-ups, which was assessed via analysis of covariance with a covariate of propensity score that adjusted for the potential confounders. Secondary outcomes were the changes in 6-MWD, SARS-CoV-2 immunoglobulins, T-lymphocytes and blood chemistry, which were evaluated via paired tests.RESULTS: Participants' ages ranged from 19 to 84 years (M = 47, standard deviation (SD)=15) 45.9% identified as male. During the 6-month convalescence, 6-MWD increased 27.0%, with a mean [95% CI] of 113 [92-134] m (p < .001). SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM decreased 33.3% (p = .002) and 43.8% (p = .009), CD4+ T cells increased 7.9% (p = .04), and the majority of blood chemistry significantly changed. The patients in the PR group acquired a greater increase in 6-MWD than those in control (unadjusted, 194 [167-221] m, p < .001; adjusted, 123 [68-181] m, p < .001), dose-responsiveness of PR on 6-MWD was observed (p < .001). No differences in immunity variables and blood chemistry were observed between groups.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest PR may be a strategy to promote the improvement of exercise capacity after COVID-19.",

The consortium maintains a centralized multi-institution registry of patients with a current or past diagnosis of cancer who developed COVID-19. Data were collected and managed using REDCap software hosted at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee. Initially, 1228 patients aged 18 years or older with prostate cancer listed as their primary malignant neoplasm were included; 122 patients with a second malignant neoplasm, insufficient follow-up, or low-quality data were excluded. Propensity matching was performed using the nearest-neighbor method with a 1:3 ratio of treated units to control units, adjusted for age, body mass index, race and ethnicity, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status score, smoking status, comorbidities (cardiovascular, pulmonary, kidney disease, and diabetes), cancer status, baseline steroid use, COVID-19 treatment, and presence of metastatic disease.Exposures: Androgen deprivation therapy use was defined as prior bilateral orchiectomy or pharmacologic ADT administered within the prior 3 months of presentation with COVID-19.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was the rate of all-cause 30-day mortality after COVID-19 diagnosis for patients receiving ADT compared with patients not receiving ADT after propensity matching.Results: After exclusions, 1106 patients with prostate cancer (before propensity score matching: median age, 73 years [IQR, 65-79 years]; 561 (51%) self-identified as non-Hispanic White) were included for analysis. Of these patients, 477 were included for propensity score matching (169 who received ADT and 308 who did not receive ADT). After propensity matching, there was no significant difference in the primary end point of the rate of all-cause 30-day mortality (OR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.42-1.42).Conclusions and Relevance: Findings from this cohort study suggest that ADT use was not associated with decreased mortality from SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, large ongoing clinical trials will provide further evidence on the role of ADT or other androgen-targeted therapies in reducing COVID-19 infection severity.",

Physicians who had participated in the primary study as interns during the 2007 to 2008 and 2008 to 2009 academic years and opted into a secondary longitudinal follow-up study were invited to complete an online survey in August 2018 and August 2020.Exposures: Work-family experience included 3 single-item questions and the Work and Family Conflict Scale, and mental health symptoms included the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcomes were work-to-family and family-to-work conflict and depressive symptoms and anxiety symptoms during August 2020. Depressive symptoms between 2018 (before the COVID-19 pandemic) and 2020 (during the COVID-19 pandemic) were compared by gender.Results: Among 215 physician parents who completed the August 2020 survey, 114 (53.0%) were female and the weighted mean (SD) age was 40.1 (3.57) years. Among physician parents, women were more likely to be responsible for childcare or schooling (24.6% [95% CI, 19.0%-30.2%] vs 0.8% [95% CI, 0.01%-2.1%]; P < .001) and household tasks (31.4% [95% CI, 25.4%-37.4%] vs 7.2% [95% CI, 3.5%-10.9%]; P < .001) during the pandemic compared with men.

In this study, we aim to measure the magnitude of inequalities in the coverage of RMNCH services. We also made an attempt to divulge the relationship between the various themes of governance and RMNCH indices.METHODS: We used National Family Health Survey dataset (2015-16) and Public Affairs Index (PAI), 2016 for the analysis. Two summative indices, namely Composite Coverage Index (CCI) and Co-Coverage (Co-Cov) indicator were constructed to measure the RMNCH coverage. Slope Index of Inequality (SII) and Relative Index of Inequality (RII) were employed to measure inequality in the distribution of coverage of RMNCH. In addition, we have used Spearman's rank correlation matrix to glean the association between governance indicator and coverage indices.RESULTS & CONCLUSIONS: Our study indicates an erratic distribution in the coverage of CCI and Co-Cov across wealth quintiles and state groups. We found that the distribution of RII values for Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal hovered around 1. Whereas, RII values for Haryana was 2.01 indicating maximum inequality across wealth quintiles. Furthermore, the essential interventions like adequate antenatal care services (ANC4) and skilled birth attendants (SBA) were the most inequitable interventions, while tetanus toxoid and Bacilli Calmette- Guerin (BCG) were least inequitable. The Spearman's rank correlation matrix demonstrated a strong and positive correlation between governance indicators and coverage indices.",

We aimed to determine the demographic and clinical factors, particularly baseline chronic conditions, associated with an increased risk of severity in COVID-19 patients from a population-based perspective and using data from electronic health records (EHR).METHODS: Retrospective, observational study in an open cohort analyzing all 68,913 individuals (mean age 44.4 years, 53.2% women) with SARS-CoV-2 infection between 15 June and 19 December 2020 using exhaustive electronic health registries. Patients were followed for 30 days from inclusion or until the date of death within that period. We performed multivariate logistic regression to analyze the association between each chronic disease and severe infection, based on hospitalization and all-cause mortality.RESULTS: 5885 (8.5%) individuals showed severe infection and old age was the most influencing factor. Congestive heart failure (odds ratio -OR- men: 1.28, OR women: 1.39), diabetes (1.37, 1.24), chronic renal failure (1.31, 1.22) and obesity (1.21, 1.26) increased the likelihood of severe infection in both sexes. Chronic skin ulcers (1.32), acute cerebrovascular disease (1.34), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (1.21), urinary incontinence (1.17) and neoplasms (1.26) in men, and infertility (1.87), obstructive sleep apnea (1.43), hepatic steatosis (1.43), rheumatoid arthritis (1.39) and menstrual disorders (1.18) in women were also associated with more severe outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Age and specific cardiovascular and metabolic diseases increased the risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infections in men and women, whereas the effects of certain comorbidities are sex specific. Future studies in different settings are encouraged to analyze which profiles of chronic patients are at higher risk of poor prognosis and should therefore be the targets of prevention and shielding strategies.",

Understanding more about these individuals can aid in developing strategies to increase their acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine. The objectives of this study were to describe COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitancy and refusal rates and associated factors in Saskatchewan, Canada.METHODS: This is a cross-sequential study that consisted of pooled responses from weighted samples of 9,252 Saskatchewan adults (?18 years) across nine rounds of data collection between May 4, 2020 and April 3, 2021. The outcome variable was vaccine intention: vaccine acceptance, hesitancy, and refusal. The independent variables were layered into socio-demographic factors, risk of exposure to coronavirus, mitigating behaviours, and perceptions of COVID-19. Data were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression and a classification and regression tree.RESULTS: Seventy-six percent of the respondents indicated that they had been or were willing to be vaccinated, 13% had not yet decided, and the remaining 11% said they would not be vaccinated. Factors that increased the likelihood of vaccine refusal and hesitancy were lower education level, financial instability, Indigenous status, and not being concerned about spreading the coronavirus. Perceiving COVID-19 to be more of a threat to one's community and believing that one had a higher risk of illness or death from COVID-19 decreased the likelihood of both vaccine refusal and hesitancy. Women and newcomers to Canada were more likely to be unsure about getting vaccinated. Respondents who did not plan to be vaccinated were less likely to wear face masks and practice physical distancing.CONCLUSION: While many Canadians have voluntarily and eagerly become vaccinated already, reaching sufficient coverage of the population is likely to require targeted efforts to convince those who are resistant or unsure. Identifying and overcoming any barriers to vaccination that exist within the socio-demographic groups we found were least likely to be vaccinated is a crucial component.",

We extracted data on patient demographics, symptoms, comorbidities, blood test results, radiographic findings, treatment after admission and clinical course. We compared clinical findings between patients with and without atypical lymphocytes, investigated the behavior of atypical lymphocytes throughout the clinical course of COVID-19, and determined the relationships among the development of pneumonia, the use of supplemental oxygen and the presence of atypical lymphocytes.RESULTS: Patients with atypical lymphocytes had a significantly higher prevalence of pneumonia (80.4% vs. 42.6%, p < 0.0001) and the use of supplemental oxygen (25.5% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.0042). The median time to the appearance of atypical lymphocytes after disease onset was eight days, and atypical lymphocytes were observed in 16/98 (16.3%) patients at the first visit. Atypical lymphocytes appeared after the confirmation of lung infiltrates in 31/41 (75.6%) patients. Of the 13 oxygen-treated patients with atypical lymphocytes, approximately two-thirds had a stable or improved clinical course after the appearance of atypical lymphocytes.CONCLUSION: Atypical lymphocytes frequently appeared in the peripheral blood of COVID-19 patients one week after disease onset. Patients with atypical lymphocytes were more likely to have pneumonia and to need supplemental oxygen; however, two-thirds of them showed clinical improvement after the appearance of atypical lymphocytes.",

These individuals may have experienced scenarios in which their moral code was violated resulting in potentially morally injurious events (PMIEs). In the present study, hierarchical linear modeling was utilized to examine the role of PMIEs on COVID-19 pandemic-related difficulties in psychosocial functioning among 211 healthcare providers (83% female, 89% White, and an average of 11.30 years in their healthcare profession [9.31]) over a 10-month span (May 2020 -March 2021). Reported exposure to PMIEs was associated with statistically significant poorer self-reported psychosocial functioning at baseline and over the course of 10-months of data collection. Within exploratory examinations of PMIE type, perceptions of transgressions by self or others (e.g., \"I acted in ways that violated my own moral code or values\"), but not perceived betrayal (e.g., \"I feel betrayed by leaders who I once trusted\"), was associated with poorer COVID-19 related psychosocial functioning (e.g., feeling connected to others, relationship with spouse or partner). Findings from this study speak to the importance of investing in intervention and prevention efforts to mitigate the consequences of exposure to PMIEs among healthcare providers. Interventions for healthcare providers targeting psychosocial functioning in the context of moral injury is an important area for future research.",

SARS-CoV-2 infection induced elevation of SL levels in both cells and sera of infected mice. A significant increase in glycosphingolipid levels was induced early post SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was essential for viral replication. This elevation could be reversed by treatment with glucosylceramide synthase inhibitors.

Focusing on results from 17,250 epidemiological investigations performed during early stages of the pandemic outbreak in Israel, we show that the distribution of carriers of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2), which causes COVID-19, is spatially correlated with two satellite-derived surface metrics: night light intensity and landscape patchiness, the latter being a measure to the urban landscape's scale-dependent spatial heterogeneity. We find that exposure to SARS-CoV-2 carriers was significantly more likely to occur in \"patchy\" parts of the city, where the urban landscape is characterized by high levels of spatial heterogeneity at relatively small, tens of meters scales. We suggest that this spatial association reflects a scale-dependent constraint imposed by the city's morphology on the cumulative behavior of the people inhabiting it. The presented results shed light on the complex interrelationships between humans and the urban landscape in which they live and interact, and open new avenues for implementation of multi-satellite data in large scale modeling of phenomena centered in urban environments.",

The virus contributing to the three epidemic waves has not been well-studied. We sequenced the genome of 22 SARS-CoV-2 strains detected in Malaysia during the second and the ongoing third wave of the COVID-19 epidemic. Detailed phylogenetic and genetic variation analyses of the SARS-CoV-2 isolate genomes were performed using these newly determined sequences and all other available sequences. Results from the analyses suggested multiple independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 into Malaysia. A new B.1.524(G) lineage with S-D614G mutation was detected in Sabah, East Malaysia and Selangor, Peninsular Malaysia on 7th October 2020 and 14th October 2020, respectively. This new B.1.524(G) group was not the direct descendant of any of the previously detected lineages. The new B.1.524(G) carried a set of genetic variations, including A701V (position variant frequency = 0.0007) in Spike protein and a novel G114T mutation at the 5'UTR. The biological importance of the specific mutations remained unknown. The sequential appearance of the mutations, however, suggests that the spread of the new B.1.524(G) lineages likely begun in Sabah and then spread to Selangor.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, young university students have experienced significant changes in their relationships, especially in the halls of residence. Previous research has shown the importance of relationship structure in contagion processes. However, there is a lack of studies in the university setting, where students live closely together. The case study methodology was applied to carry out a descriptive study. The participation consisted of 43 university students living in the same hall of residence. Social network analysis has been applied for data analysis. Factions and Girvan-Newman algorithms have been applied to detect the existing cohesive subgroups. The UCINET tool was used for the calculation of the SNA measure. A visualization of the global network will be carried out using Gephi software. After applying the Girvan-Newman and Factions, in both cases it was found that the best division into subgroups was the one that divided the network into 4 subgroups. There is high degree of cohesion within the subgroups and a low cohesion between them. The relationship between subgroup membership and gender was significant. The degree of COVID-19 infection is related to the degree of clustering between the students. College students form subgroups in their residence. Social network analysis facilitates an understanding of structural behavior during the pandemic. The study provides evidence on the importance of gender, race and the building where they live in creating network structures that favor, or not, contagion during a pandemic.",

Here, we exploit the advances of protein structure fingerprint technology to study the folding conformational changes induced by mutations. With integration of both protein sequences and folding conformations, the structures are aligned for SARS-CoV to SARS-CoV-2, including Alpha variant (lineage B.1.1.7) and Delta variant (lineage B.1.617.2). The results showed that the virus evolution with change in mutational positions and physicochemical properties increased the affinity between spike protein and ACE2, which plays a critical role in coronavirus entry into human cells. Additionally, these structural variations impact vaccine effectiveness and drug function over the course of SARS-CoV-2 evolution.

To understand the accuracy of NCITs, a clinical study was conducted with 1113 adult subjects using six different commercially available NCIT models. A total of 60 NCITs were tested with 10 units for each model. The NCIT-measured temperature was compared with the oral temperature obtained using a reference oral thermometer. The mean difference between the reference thermometer and NCIT measurement (clinical bias) was different for each NCIT model. The clinical bias ranged from just under - 0.9��C (under-reporting) to just over 0.2��C (over-reporting). The individual differences ranged from - 3 to + 2��C in extreme cases, with the majority of the differences between - 2 and + 1��C. Depending upon the NCIT model, 48% to 88% of the individual temperature measurements were outside the labeled accuracy stated by the manufacturers. The sensitivity of the NCIT models for detecting subject's temperature above 38��C ranged from 0 to 0.69. Overall, our results indicate that some NCIT devices may not be consistently accurate enough to determine if subject's temperature exceeds a specific threshold of 38��C. Model-to-model variability and individual model accuracy in the displayed temperature were found to be outside of acceptable limits. Accuracy and credibility of the NCITs should be thoroughly evaluated before using them as an effective screening tool.",

However, empirical evidence is limited or partial. Here, we present an integrated histopathological and virological analysis of CBs sampled at autopsy from four subjects (2 males and 2 females; age: >70 years old) who died of COVID-19. Histopathological, immunohistochemical and molecular investigation techniques were employed to characterize Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome - Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV2) viral invasion and inflammatory reaction. SARS-CoV2 RNA was detected in the CBs of three cases through Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). In these cases, positive immunostaining for Nucleocapsid and Spike protein were also demonstrated, mainly at the level of large roundish cells consistent with type I cells, confirming direct CB invasion. In these cases, T lymphocytes showed focal aggregations in the CBs, suggestive of local inflammatory reaction. Blood congestion and microthrombosis were also found in one of the positive cases. Intriguingly, microthrombosis, blood congestion and microhaemorrages were also bilaterally detected in the CBs of the negative case, supporting the possibility of COVID-19 effects on the CB even in the absence of its direct invasion. SARS-CoV-2 direct invasion of the CB is confirmed through both immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR, with likely involvement of different cell types. We also reported histopathological findings which could be ascribed to local and/or systemic actions of SARS-CoV-2 and which could potentially affect chemoreception.",

However, SARS-CoV-2 variants are rapidly spreading worldwide from the sites of initial identification. The variants of concern (VOC) B.1.1.7 (Alpha), B.1.351 (Beta), P.1 (Gamma) and B.1.167.2 (Delta) showed mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein potentially able to cause escape from nAb responses with a consequent reduction of efficacy of vaccines and mAbs-based therapy. We produced the recombinant RBD (rRBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein from the Wuhan-Hu 1 reference sequence in a mammalian system, for mice immunization to isolate new mAbs with neutralizing activity. Here we describe four mAbs that were able to bind the rRBD in Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay and the transmembrane full-length spike protein expressed in HEK293T cells by flow cytometry assay. Moreover, the mAbs recognized the RBD in supernatants of SARS-CoV-2 infected VERO E6 cells by Western Blot under non-reducing condition or in supernatants of cells infected with lentivirus pseudotyped for spike protein, by immunoprecipitation assay. Three out of four mAbs lost their binding efficiency to completely N-deglycosylated rRBD and none was able to bind the same recombinant protein expressed in Escherichia coli, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by three mAbs are generated by the conformational structure of the glycosylated native protein. Of particular relevance, three mAbs were able to inhibit Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 infection of VERO E6 cells in a plaque-reduction neutralization test and the Wuhan SARS-CoV-2 as well as the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta VOC in a pseudoviruses-based neutralization test. These mAbs represent important additional tools for diagnosis and therapy of COVID-19 and may contribute to the understanding of the functional structure of SARS-CoV-2 RBD.",

Two different combinations of variables including model 1 (all variables: gender, height, weight, exercise, body segment angles) and model 2 (gender, body segment angles) were tested. The MLP regression and a conventional regression (quadratic regression) were both conducted, and the performance was compared.RESULTS: In the overall regression analysis, the quadratic regression showed better performance than the MLP regression. For the postural discomfort group-specific analysis, MLP regression showed greater performance than the quadratic regression especially in the high postural discomfort group. The MLP regression also showed better performance in predicting postural discomfort among individuals who had a variability of subjective rating among different postures compared to the quadratic regression. The deep learning for postural discomfort prediction would be useful for the efficient job risk assessment for various industries that involve prolonged static postures.CONCLUSIONS: The deep learning for postural discomfort prediction would be useful for the efficient job risk assessment for various industries that involve prolonged static postures. This information would be meaningful as basic research data to study in predicting psychophysical data in ergonomics.",

Here, we screened SC2r-CoVs in 172 samples from 163 pangolin individuals of four species, and detected positive signals in muscles of four Manis javanica and, for the first time, one M. pentadactyla. Phylogeographic analysis of pangolin mitochondrial DNA traced their origins from Southeast Asia. Using in-solution hybridization capture sequencing, we assembled a partial pangolin SC2r-CoV (pangolin-CoV) genome sequence of 22 895 bp (MP20) from the M. pentadactyla sample. Phylogenetic analyses revealed MP20 was very closely related to pangolin-CoVs that were identified in M. javanica seized by Guangxi Customs. A genetic contribution of bat coronavirus to pangolin-CoVs via recombination was indicated. Our analysis revealed that the genetic diversity of pangolin-CoVs is substantially higher than previously anticipated. Given the potential infectivity of pangolin-CoVs, the high genetic diversity of pangolin-CoVs alerts the ecological risk of zoonotic evolution and transmission of pathogenic SC2r-CoVs.",

The genes activated by safeners in crops are similar to the genes causing herbicide resistance through increased metabolism in weeds. This work investigated the effect of the safener isoxadifen-ethyl (IS) in combination with fenoxaprop-p-ethyl (FE) on the evolution of herbicide resistance in Echinochloa crus-galli under recurrent selection. Reduced susceptibility was observed in the progeny after recurrent selection with both FE alone and with FE + IS for two generations (G2) compared to the parental population (G0). The resistance index found in G2 after FE + IS selection was similar as when FE was used alone, demonstrating that the safener did not increase the rate or magnitude of herbicide resistance evolution. G2 progeny selected with FE alone and the combination of FE + IS had increased survival to herbicides from other mechanisms of action relative to the parental G0 population. One biotype of G2 progeny had increased constitutive expression of glutathione-S-transferase (GST1) after recurrent selection with FE + IS. G2 progeny had increased expression of two P450 genes (CYP71AK2 and CYP72A122) following treatment with FE, while G2 progeny had increased expression of five P450 genes (CYP71AK2, CYP72A258, CYP81A12, CYP81A14 and CYP81A21) after treatment with FE + IS. Repeated selection with low doses of FE with or without the safener IS decreased E. crus-galli control and showed potential for cross-resistance evolution. Addition of safener did not further decrease herbicide sensitivity in second generation progeny; however, the recurrent use of safener in combination with FE resulted in safener-induced increased expression of several CYP genes. This is the first report using safener as an additional factor to study herbicide resistance evolution in weeds under experimental recurrent selection.",

We have functionally characterized a unique DREB transcription factor BaDBL1 from the DT moss Bryum argenteum. Expression pattern analysis revealed that BaDBL1 was induced by dehydration-rehydration, salt, cold, and abscisic acid treatments. BaDBL1 was localized in the nucleus and had a transactivation region in its C-terminal region. Overexpression of BaDBL1 in Arabidopsis resulted in significantly increased osmotic and salt stress tolerance, as illustrated by higher fresh weight and antioxidase activities (SOD, POD and CAT) compared with WT under osmotic and salt stresses. Moreover, the transcription of stress-responsive genes, such as AtRD29A and AtCOR15A, AtLEA in BaDBL1-overexpressing lines were significantly up-regulated under osmotic and salt stresses compared with WT. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that BaDBL1-overexpression affected the lignin biosynthesis pathway by improving lignin content and regulating lignin-biosynthesis-related genes under osmotic stress. The results suggest that BaDBL1 may regulate plant tolerance to stress by enhancing anti-oxidase activities, regulating expression of stress-related genes and effecting the lignin biosynthesis, making BaDBL1 a candidate gene for stress tolerance improvement in crops.",

Moreover, even low Cd concentrations present in the soil can result in the abatement of plant performance, leading to lower grain yield. Studies examining the molecular basis of plant defense against Cd-induced oxidative stress could pave the way in creating superior rice varieties that display an optimal antioxidative defense system to cope with Cd toxicity. In this study, we showed that after one day of Cd exposure, hydroponically grown rice plants exhibited adverse shoot biomass and leaf growth effects. Cadmium accumulates especially in the roots and the leaf meristematic region, leading to a disturbance of manganese homeostasis in both the roots and leaves. The leaf growth zone showed an increased amount of lipid peroxidation indicating that Cd exposure disturbed the oxidative balance. We propose that an increased expression of genes related to the glutathione metabolism such as glutathione synthetase 2, glutathione reductase and phytochelatin synthase 2, rather than genes encoding for antioxidant enzymes, is important in combating early Cd toxicity within the leaves of rice plants. Furthermore, the upregulation of two RESPIRATORY BURST OXIDASE HOMOLOG genes together with a Cd concentration-dependent increase of abscisic acid might cause stomatal closure or cell wall modification, potentially leading to the observed leaf growth reduction. Whereas abscisic acid was also elevated at long term exposure, a decrease of the growth hormone auxin might further contribute to growth inhibition and concomitantly, an increase in salicylic acid might stimulate the activity of antioxidative enzymes after a longer period of Cd exposure. In conclusion, a clear interplay between phytohormones and the oxidative challenge affect plant growth and acclimation during exposure to Cd stress.",

In this work, we investigated the possibility to improve resistance to either or both diseases by combining different resistance mechanisms. To this aim, we stacked in the same wheat genotype transgenes controlling the DON-to-D3G conversion by specific UDP-glucosyltransferases (UGT) and the inhibition of cell wall degrading enzymes (CWDEs) by glycosidase inhibitors. We obtained: i) a durum wheat UGT+PMEI double-transgenic line constitutively expressing the HvUGT13248 and AcPMEI genes, coding for a barley UGT and a kiwi pectin methylesterase inhibitor, respectively; ii) a bread wheat UGT+PGIP line, expressing in floral tissues the HvUGT13248 gene and constitutively the PvPGIP2 gene, coding for a bean polygalacturonase inhibiting protein. We observed that both UGT+PMEI and UGT+PGIP plants exhibited increased resistance against Fusarium graminearum in FHB, further reducing by 10-20 % FHB symptoms as compared to the lines carrying the individual transgenes, and of up to 50 % as compared to wild-type plants. On the other hand, double-transgenic UGT+PMEI seedlings exhibited similar FCR symptoms as the UGT single transgenic line after infection with F. culmorum, indicating no contribution of the PMEI transgene to FCR resistance. This result is also supported by the inability of AcPMEI or PvPGIP2, constitutively expressed in durum wheat transgenic lines, to counteract F. graminearum in FCR. We also verified that F. graminearum produces PG and PME activity on infected wheat crown. We conclude that CWDEs inhibition combined with UGT-based DON detoxification contribute in an additive manner to limiting F. graminearum in FHB. Conversely, UGT-based DON detoxification is the only mechanism contributing to resistance observed against FCR. Indeed, the reinforcement of pectin does not enhance resistance against FCR.",

Therefore, we identified two cold induced gene (CIG) PavCIG1 and PavCIG2 from sweet cherry, which were closely to PpCBF and PyDREB from Prunus persica and Prunus yedoensis by using phylogenetic analysis, suggesting conserved functions with these evolutionarily closer DREB subfamily genes. Subcellular localization analysis indicated that, PavCIG1 and PavCIG2 were both localized in the nucleus. The seasonal expression levels of PavCIG1 and PavCIG2 were higher at the stage of endodormancy in winter, and induced by low temperature. Ectopic expression of PavCIG1 and PavCIG2 resulted in a delayed flowering in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, PavCIG2 increased light-responsive gene PavHY5 transcriptional activity by binding to its promoter, meanwhile, PavHY5-mediated positive feedback regulated PavCIG2. Moreover, ABA-responsive protein PavABI5-like could also increase transcriptional activity of PavCIG and PavCIG2. In addition, PavCIG and PavCIG2 target gene PavCAL-like was involved in floral initiation, demonstrated by ectopic expression in Arabidopsis.

Expression of a miR169n target mimicry construct (MIM169n) which functioned as a sponge to trap miR169n resulted in enhanced resistance of transgenic plants to both osmotic stress at the post-germination stage and drought stress at the seedling stage. MIM169n plants had a higher relative water content (RWC) and proline content, lower relative electrolyte leakage (REL), and showed higher antioxidative capability compared with those of control (CK) plants under drought stress. Moreover, NF-YA8 was verified as a target of miR169n, and overexpression of NF-YA8 led to improved tolerance of rapeseed to osmotic stress at the post-germination stage.

Tyrosine decarboxylase (TyDC) plays a fundamental role in many secondary metabolite reactions in higher plants (including those involving dopamine). Our aims of this study are: 1) to identify the role of TyDC in dopamine derivative biosynthesis and its function in long-term moderate drought conditions; and 2) to explore the role of MdTyDC in plant growth and development as well as the drought stress response. Wild type and three independently apple plants overexpression of MdTyDC were treated for long-term moderate drought stress. The growth and physiological parameters of apple plant, photosynthetic capacity, antioxidant enzymes activity, water use efficiency (WUE), stomatal behavior, amino acid content and dopamine content were detected under long-term moderate drought stress. Overexpression of MdTyDC (OE) in apple showed better growth performance, higher photosynthetic capacity and higher capacity for photochemical reactions than wild type lines (WT). Under long-term moderate drought stress, OE lines showed higher WUE, increased ABA content, decreased stomatal aperture, higher antioxidant activity, lower accumulation of ROS and increases in amino acids, such as proline, phenylalanine and lysine. In addition, qRT-PCR revealed higher gene expression of MdTyDC and dopamine content in OE compared with WT lines under long-term moderate drought stress. These results indicate that MdTyDC confers long-term moderate drought tolerance by improving photosynthetic capacity, WUE, antioxidant activity, dopamine content and changing the contents of amino acids (such as proline accumulation).",

Deciphering the regulatory network and identification of the key regulators mediating AsA biosynthesis is vital for fruit nutrition and quality improvement. To date, however, the key transcription factors regulating AsA metabolism during kiwifruit developmental and ripening processes remains largely unknown. Here, we generated a putative transcriptional regulatory network mediating ascorbate metabolism by transcriptome co-expression analysis. Further studies identified an ethylene response factor AcERF91 from this regulatory network, which is highly co-expressed with a GDP-galactose phosphorylase encoding gene (AcGGP3) during fruit developmental and ripening processes. Through dual-luciferase reporter and yeast one-hybrid assays, it was shown that AcERF91 is able to bind and directly activate the activity of the AcGGP3 promoter. Furthermore, transient expression of AcERF91 in kiwifruit fruits resulted in a significant increase in AsA content and AcGGP3 transcript level, indicating a positive role of AcERF91 in controlling AsA accumulation via regulation of the expression of AcGGP3. Overall, our results provide a new insight into the regulation of AsA metabolism in kiwifruit.",

Although the regulation of MADS-box transcription factor (MADS-RIN) controlling fruit ripening has been widely reported, its mechanisms underlying need to be further improved. Here, we characterized a novel tomato E6-like gene, E6-2, whose transcripts showed a high accumulation in fruit ripening stages (Breaker, Breaker+4 and Breaker+7), but a low level was observed in Never ripe (Nr) and ripening inhibitor (rin) mutants. MADS-RIN directly activates the expression of E6-2 in vivo. Additionally, a remarkable reduction of E6-2 was observed in wild-type (WT) tomato fruits at the MG stage treated with 1-MCP. RNAi-mediated silencing of E6-2 resulted in delayed fruit ripening, reduced accumulation of the total carotenoid and lycopene, reduced content of ethylene production, and increased contents of the total pectin, cellulose, starch and soluble sugar. Moreover, the expression of carotenoid biosynthesis genes (PSY1, PDS and ZDS), ripening-related genes (CNR, PG and ERF4), ethylene biosynthesis genes (ACS2, ACO1 and ACO3), ethylene-responsive genes (E4 and E8) and cell wall metabolism genes (TBG4, PL, EXP1 and XTH5) were inhibited in E6-2 -RNAi lines.

Here we used Jacobaea vulgaris, Jacobaea aquatica, two F1 and four F2 hybrids that differed in their pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) bouquet as a study system. A series of clones of these genotypes were investigated during their vegetative stage spanning 14 months in a semi-natural environment. We found that the total PA concentration in roots and shoots showed a gradual increase until the spring of the second year, whereafter it dropped substantially in shoots. The variation in PA composition due to seasonal changes was significant but relatively small. Senecionine-like PAs were the dominant PAs in roots, while jacobine-/erucifoline-like PAs were dominant in shoots. The variation of PA concentration was significantly correlated with temperature, day length, and plant age. A correlation analysis showed that PAs were not reallocated when biomass was lost in winter. Overall, our study showed that PA composition of each genotype changed over seasons in a different manner but seasonal variation did not overrule the differences in PA composition among genotypes.",

The phylogenetic relatedness of the ginsenoside biosynthetic genes in the two species was previously unknown. The final steps of ginsenoside biosynthesis are the glycosylations of hydroxylated triterpenes, protopanaxadiol (PPD) and protopanaxatriol (PPT), and their glycosylated forms by UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGTs). Ginsenoside biosynthetic UGTs have been identified in Panax but not in Gynostemma. Through a biochemical screening of Gynostemma UGTs (GpUGTs), we herein identified three groups of ginsenoside biosynthetic GpUGTs. These groups comprise: two GpUGTs that belong to the UGT71 family and glucosylate the C20-OH positions of PPD- and PPT-type ginsenosides; one GpUGT that belongs to the UGT74 family and glucosylates the C3-OH position of PPD-type ginsenosides; and two GpUGTs that belong to the UGT94 family and add a glucose to the C3-O-glucosides of PPD-type ginsenosides. These GpUGTs belong to the same UGT families as the ginsenoside biosynthetic Panax UGTs (PgUGTs). However, GpUGTs and PgUGTs belong to different subfamilies. Furthermore, cucumber UGTs orthologous to GpUGTs do not glucosylate ginsenosides. These results collectively suggest that, during evolution, P. ginseng and G. pentaphyllum independently opted to use the same UGT families to synthesize ginsenosides.",

These MSP comprise histidine-aspartate kinases (HKs) as receptors, histidine phosphotransfer (HPts) proteins acting as phosphorelay proteins, and response regulators (RRs), some of which act as transcription factors (type-B RRs). In previous studies, we identified partners of the poplar osmosensing signaling pathway, composed of two HKs, three main HPts, and six type-B RRs. To date, it is unresolved as to how cytokinin or osmotic stress signal specificity is achieved in the MSP in order to generate specific responses. Here, we present a large-scale interaction study of poplar type-B RR dimerization. Using the two-hybrid assay, we were able to show the homodimerization of type-B RRs, the heterodimerization of duplicated type-B RRs, and surprisingly, a lack of interaction between some type-B RRs belonging to different duplicates. The lack of interaction of the duplicates RR12-14 and RR18-19, which are involved in the osmosensing pathway has been confirmed by BiFC experiments. This study reveals, for the first time, an overview of type-B RR dimerization in poplar and makes way for the hypothesis that signal specificity for cytokinin or osmotic stress could be in part due to the fact that it is impossible for specific type-B RRs to heterodimerize.",

Overexpression of MxRop1 also increased reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Moreover, active state of MxRop1 (CA-MxRop1) interacted with N-terminal region of MxrbohD1, one ROS synthesis gene. When MxrbohD1 was overexpressed in apple calli, it showed significantly increased H2O2 content, fresh weight and FCR activity, while ROS inhibitor application dramatically inhibited FCR activity, demonstrating ROS produced by MxrbohD1 regulated Fe deficiency responses. Furthermore, using Agrobacterium rhizogenes transformation, MxrbohD1 was overexpressed in apple roots, with increased expression of Fe deficiency-induced genes and increased root FCR activity. Under Fe deficiency, it exhibited slight leaf yellowing phenotype. Co-expression of CA-MxRop1 and MxrbohD1 significantly induced ROS generation.

Here, we investigated the function of RNase H1 in Physcomitrium (Physcomitrella) patens to illustrate its important role in the evolution of plants. We found that PpRNH1A dysfunction seriously affected shoot growth and branch formation in P. patens, revealing a noticeable functional difference between PpRNH1A and AtRNH1A of Arabidopsis. Furthermore, auxin signaling was significantly affected at the transcriptional level in PpRNH1A mutant plants, as a result of the accumulation of R-loops at several auxin-related genes. This study provides evidence that PpRNH1A regulates the development of P. patens by controlling R-loop formation at specific loci to modulate the transcription of auxin-related genes. It also highlights the interspecific functional differences between early land plants and vascular plants, despite crucial and conserved role of RNase H1 played in maintaining R-loop homeostasis.",

To assess the degree of resistance in four different cultivars, we quantified visible symptoms and fungal DNA and performed expression analyses of genes involved in plant defence and ROS scavenging. To obtain insight into the interaction between fungus and host, we determined the activity of 19 key enzymes of carbohydrate and antioxidant metabolism. The pathogen impact was also phenotyped non-invasively by sensor-based multireflectance and -fluorescence imaging. Symptoms, regulation of stress-related genes and pathogen DNA content distinguished the cultivar Guld as being resistant. Severity of net blotch symptoms was also strongly correlated with the dynamics of enzyme activities already within the first day of infection. In contrast to the resistant cultivar, the three susceptible cultivars showed a higher reflectance over seven spectral bands and higher fluorescence intensities at specific excitation wavelengths.

Treatment of GUS reporter lines with Indole Acetic Acid (IAA), sucrose, and light apparently enhanced the abundance of miR775 in root tissue. miR775 overexpressing (miR775OX) lines showed changes in root architecture, including increased primary root growth and root hair, by targeting GalT. miR775OX lines also showed tolerance toward low Pi.

We previously produced preliminary evidence that Cla010726, which encodes a gibberellin 20-oxidase-like protein, is the primary gene controlling dwarfism in watermelon. However, the underlying genetic mechanism was unknown. In this study, we characterized the spontaneous recessive mutant dsh, which is a gibberellin (GA)-de?cient mutant. Many of the phenotypic traits of dsh plants are similar to those of known GA-de?cient mutants. The dsh plants were sensitive to exogenous bioactive GAs, which increased seedling height. Moreover, a quantitative analysis of endogenous GA3 proved that the bioactive GA3 content was substantially lower than normal in dsh. Additionally, the T5ClaGA20ox RNAi plants generally exhibited dwarfism, with short stems and internodes as well as small leaves and fruit. An examination of the transgenic plants carrying the ClaGA20ox1 promoter-GUS and mutant ClaGA20ox2 promoter-GUS constructs confirmed that two promoter sites are involved in the regulation of ClaGA20ox expression. Hence, mutations in the promoter of the GA20ox gene, which encodes a key enzyme involved in gibberellin biosynthesis, lead to the dwarfism of watermelon plants.

Results showed that reinoculated plants of the 'Pera' sweet orange/'Rangpur' lime and 'Tahiti' acid lime/'Tropical' sunki combinations with more and less sensitive varieties to Phytophthora, presented smaller stem lesions and increased frequency of full methylation and hemimethylation rates, compared to inoculated plants. In contrast, 'Tahiti' acid lime/'Rangpur' lime, two highly sensitive varieties, and 'Pera'/'Tropical' sunki, two much less sensitive varieties, showed high increases in the frequency of hemimethylation and non-methylation levels. Results suggest that in citrus, both the scion-rootstock interaction and DNA methylation affect the response to P. citrophthora infection. Reinoculated plants, depending on the combination, showed changes in intracellular hyphae growth through the formation of sets of fibers and crystal accumulation in the periderm, cortex, and phloem. In addition, starch grain concentration was higher in reinoculated plants in comparison to inoculated plants. These findings support the assumption that DNA methylation is a plant defense mechanism and therefore may be exploited to improve the response of plants to the gummosis of P. citrophthora in citrus.",

However, the molecular mechanisms that coordinate both auxin and ethylene signals during peach fruit ripening remain unclear. In this study, we show that PpIAA1 and PpERF4 act as key players in a positive feedback loop, and promote peach fruit ripening by directly binding to and enhancing the activity of target gene promoters. PpIAA1 increased the expression of the ethylene biosynthesis gene PpACS1. Furthermore, PpERF4 enhanced the transcription of PpACO1 and PpIAA1 genes by binding to their promoters. Additionally, PpIAA1 and PpERF4 bound to each other to form a complex, which then enhanced the transcription of abscisic acid biosynthesis genes (PpNCED2 and PpNCED3) and the fruit softening gene (PpPG1) to levels higher than those achieved by each transcription factor individually. Moreover, overexpression of PpIAA1 in tomato accelerated fruit ripening and shortened the fruit shelf-life by increasing the production of ethylene and the expression levels of ripening regulator genes. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying peach fruit ripening and softening via auxin and ethylene signaling pathways.",

A mapping population derived from a cross between a salt-sensitive Korean cultivar, Cheongja 3, and a salt-tolerant landrace, IT162669, was used to identify quantitative trait loci (QTLs) conferring salt tolerance in soybean. Following treatment with 120 mM NaCl for 2 weeks, phenotypic traits representing physiological damage, leaf Na+ content, and K+/Na+ ratio were characterized. Among the QTLs mapped on a high-density genetic map harboring 2,630 single nucleotide polymorphism markers, we found two novel major loci, qST6, on chromosome 6, and qST10, on chromosome 10, which controlled traits related to ion toxicity and physiology in response to salinity, respectively. These loci were distinct from the previously known salt tolerance allele on chromosome 3. Other QTLs associated with abiotic stress overlapped with the genomic regions of qST6 and qST10, or with their paralogous regions. Based on the functional annotation and parental expression differences, we identified eight putative candidate genes, two in qST6 and six in qST10, which included a phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and an ethylene response factor. This study provides additional genetic resources to breed soybean cultivars with enhanced salt tolerance.",

Here, we report that OsPLC3 was ubiquitously expressed in various tissues during the development of rice. The expression of YFP-tagged OsPLC3 was observed at the plasma membrane (PM), cytoplasm and nucleus of rice protoplasts, onion epidermal cells and tobacco leaves. The catalytic activity of OsPLC3 was measured using the thin-layer chromatography (TLC) method. The inhibition of OsPLC3 expression was detected in the treatments of NaCl and mannitol. Overexpression (OE) of OsPLC3 produced plants showing more sensitive to osmotic stresses when they were compared to the wild-type (HJ) and osplc3 mutants, the phenomena such as decreased plant fresh weight and increased water loss rate (WLR) were observed. Under the treatment of NaCl or mannitol, expressions of a subset osmotic stress-related genes were altered, in both OE and osplc3 mutant lines. In addition, the expressions and the enzyme activities of reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavengers were significantly decreased in OE lines, leading to over-accumulation of ROS together with less osmotic adjustment substances including proline, soluble sugars and soluble proteins in OE plants which caused the growth inhibition. Thus, our results suggested that, via modulating ROS homeostasis, OsPLC3 is involved in responses to the osmotic stress in rice.",

Here, our cytological studies by ultrastructural observation revealed that the sieve element-companion cell complex in carpellary bundle was symplasmically interconnected with surrounding parenchyma cells at the early and late fruit developmental stages, whereas it was symplasmically isolated at middle stage. Consistently, real-time imaging showed that fluorescent tracer 6(5)carboxyfluorescein was confined to phloem strands at middle stage but released into surrounding parenchymal cells at early and late stages. Enzymatic assay showed that sucrose synthase act as the key enzyme catalyzing the progress of Suc degradation post-unloading pathway whether in pericarp or in seed, while vacuolar acid invertase and neutral invertase play compensation roles in sucrose decomposition. Sugar transporter XsSWEET10 had a high expression profile in fruit, especially at middle stage. XsSWEET10 is a plasma membrane-localized protein and heterologous expression in SUC2-deficient yeast strain SUSY7/ura3 confirmed its ability to uptake sucrose.

Tartary buckwheat (Fagopyrum tataricum), a dicotyledonous crop, has a good adaptability to low N (LN) stress; however, little is known regarding the associated mechanisms underlying this adaptation. In this study, 932 putative SSPs were genome-wide characterized in TB genome. Of these SSPs, 233 SSPs were annotated as established SSPs, such as CLE, RALF, PSK, and CEP peptides. The gene expression of 675 putative SSPs was detected in five tissues and 258 SSPs were tissue-specific expressed genes. To analyze the responses of TB SSPs to LN, the dynamic expression analysis of TB roots under LN stress was conducted by RNA-seq. The expression of 378 putative TB SSP genes was detected with diverse expression patterns under LN stress, and some important LN-responsive SSPs were identified. Co-expression analysis suggested SSPs may regulate the adaptability of TB under LN conditions by modulating the expression of the genes involved in N transport and assimilation and IAA signaling. Furthermore, 53 LN stress-responsive RLKs encoding genes were identified and they were predicted as potential SSP receptors. This study expands the repertoire of SSPs in plants and provides useful information for further investigation of the functions of Tartary buckwheat SSPs in LN stress responses.",

Sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis showed that this transcription factor was most similar to the LWD1 protein, and it was thus named GbLWD1-like. This gene was expressed mainly in the leaves, followed by the roots. Phenotypic analysis showed that the transgenic plants grew better, were taller, and had significantly more roots than the control check (CK) plants. Moreover, the transgenic plants were more tolerant to salt stress than the CK plants. After 11 days of salt treatment, all the leaves of the CK plants had dried up and fallen off, whereas in the transgenic lines, only the edges of the bottom leaves had turned yellow. Under salt stress, the expression levels of some genes related to salt tolerance were higher in the transgenic plants than in the CK plants.

We found that application of exogenous melatonin not only induced anthocyanin biosynthesis, but also increased endogenous H2O2 and O2‾ content in pear fruits. The effect of melatonin on anthocyanin biosynthesis was abolished by inhibitors of RBOH. We also observed that genes encoding RBOH (PuRBOHF) were ubiquitously and highly expressed after melatonin treatment. Transient PuRBOHF overexpression significantly enhanced anthocyanin accumulation and activated transcription of anthocyanin biosynthesis genes, whereas PuRBOHF silencing repressed melatonin-promoted anthocyanin accumulation and H2O2 production. Moreover, RBOH-derived H2O2 induced PuMYB10 transcription, and PuRBOHF enhanced the PuMYB10-induced activation of the PuUFGT promoter. PuMYB10, in turn, activated PuRBOHF transcription, revealing a positive feedback loop. These results provide molecular evidence supporting the essential roles of PuRBOHF-dependent H2O2 in melatonin-induced anthocyanin accumulation in pears.",

They are synthesized on the cytoplasmic surface of the endoplasmic reticulum and transported into the vacuole for storage. Previous reports have suggested that glutathione S-transferase (GST) is involved in anthocyanin transport. However, due to the limitation of plant materials, most GSTs only participate in the cyanidin or delphinidin transport pathway. Here, an anthocyanin-related GST, ScGST3, was identified from the transcriptome of cineraria. The expression pattern of ScGST3 was highly consistent with anthocyanin accumulation in ray florets. Molecular complementation of Arabidopsis tt19 indicated that the overexpression of ScGST3 restores the anthocyanin-deficient phenotype of the mutant. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of ScGST3 in carmine and blue cineraria leaves could inhibit anthocyanin accumulation, further confirming the function of ScGST3 in anthocyanin accumulation. In vitro assays showed that ScGST3 increases the water solubility of cyanidin-3-O-glucoside (C3G) and delphinidin-3-O-glucosid (D3G). In addition, we also identified two anthocyanin-related MYB transcription factors, ScMYB3 and ScMYB6. The expression pattern of these two genes was also highly consistent with anthocyanin accumulation. Faded abaxial leaf phenotypes were observed after the silencing of ScMYB3 and ScMYB6, and the expression levels of partial structural genes were repressed. Based on the results from dual-luciferase assays and yeast one-hybrid assays, ScMYB3 can activate the promoter of ScGST3. Collectively, the transcription of ScGST3 is regulated by ScMYB3, which plays an important role in the transport of C3G and D3G in cineraria.",

Repairing damaged plastid DNA resulted in point mutation, large deletion and small inversion surrounding the rpoB gene by homologous recombination and/or microhomology-mediated recombination. In an albino line, microhomology-mediated recombination via a pair of 12-bp direct repeats between rpoC2 and ycf2 genes generated the chimeric ycf2-rpoC2 subgenome, with the level about 3- to 5-fold higher for subgenomic DNA than ycf2. Additionally, the expression of chimeric ycf2-rpoC2 transcripts versus ycf2 mRNA agreed well with the level of corresponding DNA.

Empirical evidence indicates that compliance with the guidelines improves the quality of healthcare and reduces adverse effects. The study aimed to evaluate practices of oxytocin provision for labour induction and augmentation in two maternity units in Poland.METHODS: The article presents a prospective observational study. Data from 545 (n = 545) labours was collected in two maternity units. First, the total dose (the total amount of oxytocin provided from the beginning in the labour ward until delivery including the III and IV stage of labour) and cumulative dose of oxytocin (the amount of oxytocin given until the birth of the neonate) administered to women during labour was calculated. Then, the relationship between the cumulative dose of oxytocin and short term perinatal outcomes (mode of delivery, use of epidural anaesthesia, Apgar scores, birth weight and postpartum blood loss) was analysed. Finally, the compliance of oxytocin supply during labour with national guidelines in the following five criteria: medium, start dose, escalation rate, interval, the continuation of infusion after established labour was examined.RESULTS: The average cumulative dose of oxytocin administrated to women before birth was 4402 mU following labour induction and 2366 mU following labour augmentation. The actual administration of oxytocin deviated both from the unit and national guidelines in 93.6% of all observed labours (mainly because of continuation of infusion after established labour). We found no statistically significant correlation between the cumulative dose of oxytocin administered and mode of delivery, immediate postpartum blood loss or Apgar scores. There was no observed effect of cumulative dose oxytocin on short-term perinatal outcomes. The two units participating in the study had similar protocols and did not differ significantly in terms of total oxytocin dose, rates of induction and augmentation - the only observed difference was the mode of delivery.CONCLUSIONS: The study showed no effect of the mean cumulative oxytocin dose on short-term perinatal outcomes and high rate of non-compliance of the practice of oxytocin administration for labour induction and augmentation with the national recommendations. Cooperation between different professional groups of maternity care providers should be considered in building national guidelines for maternity care.. Further studies investigating possible long-term effects of the meant cumulative dose of oxytocin and the reasons for non-compliance of practice with guidelines should be carried out.",

A descriptive phenomenological approach was employed for the analysis of data.RESULTS: Analysis of data yielded four major themes: (a) medicalization of childbirth, (b) preparing for a VBAC, (c) birth environment, and (d) healing through VBAC. On the whole, the women interviewed described their previous experience of CS as traumatic, in contrast to vaginal childbirth. VBAC was considered an utterly positive experience that made the women feel empowered and proud of themselves.CONCLUSION: This study offers valuable insight into a newly researched subject in Cyprus, which is necessary for advancing perinatal care in Cyprus. The findings indicate that women need evidence-based information, guidelines on birthing options, good preparation with tailored information and personalized care for a successful vaginal birth after a previous caesarean section. Proper, non-biased, consultations are a main factor that affects women's choice of mode of birth. The introduction of new, women-friendly perinatal strategies that respect and promote childbirth rights is imperative in the case of Cyprus. All women have the right to exercise informed choice and the choice to alternative birthing options.",

Current low-intensity psychological therapy for perinatal depression is a supported self-help approach informed by cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) principles. Interpersonal counselling (IPC) may be a more appropriate low-intensity talking therapy for addressing the problems experienced by pregnant women with depression. A randomised feasibility trial (ADAGIO) has compared the acceptability of offering IPC for mild-moderate antenatal depression in routine NHS services compared to low-intensity CBT. This paper reports on a nested qualitative study which explored women's views and expectations of therapy, experiences of receiving IPC, and Psychological Wellbeing Practitioners (PWPs - junior mental health workers) views of delivering the low-intensity therapy.METHODS: A qualitative study design using in-depth semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Thirty-two pregnant women received talking therapy within the ADAGIO trial; 19 contributed to the interview study from July 2019 to January 2020; 12 who had IPC and seven who had CBT. All six PWPs trained in IPC took part in a focus group or interview. Interviews and focus groups were recorded, transcribed, anonymised, and analysed using thematic methods.RESULTS: Pregnant women welcomed being asked about their mental health in pregnancy and having the chance to have support in accessing therapy. The IPC approach helped women to identify triggers for depression and explored relationships using strategies such as 'promoting self-awareness through mood timelines', 'identifying their circles of support', 'developing communication skills and reciprocity in relationships', and 'asking for help'. PWPs compared how IPC differed from their prior experiences of delivering low-intensity CBT. They reported that IPC included a useful additional emotional component which was relevant to the perinatal period.CONCLUSIONS: Identifying and treating depression in pregnancy is important for the future health of both mother and child. Low-intensity perinatal-specific talking therapies delivered by psychological wellbeing practitioners in routine NHS primary care services in England are acceptable to pregnant women with mild-moderate depression. The strategies used in IPC to manage depression, including identifying triggers for low mood, and communicating the need for help, may be particularly appropriate for the perinatal period.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ISRCTN 11513120. 02/05/2019.",

During the COVID-19 era, only 3 cases of new-onset MCD and a case of MCD relapse were reported following the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine. We herein report the first case of MCD after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine.CASE PRESENTATION: A 43-year-old man presented to hospital 3 weeks after receiving the first dose of the Moderna vaccine, with both bilateral lower extremities and scrotal edema. He initially developed a sudden-onset bilateral lower extremities swelling on day 7 post-vaccine. He, then, developed dyspnea and scrotal swelling over a time span of 2 weeks. On physical examination, his blood pressure was 150/92 mmHg. There was a decreased air entry at lung bases, bilateral lower extremities and scrotal edema. Labs revealed hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia and 15 g of proteinuria. His immunologic and serologic work up was negative. Renal biopsy showed concomitant MCD and IgA nephropathy. Patient was treated with oral steroids and had a good response; his edema resolved, serum albumin improved, and proteinuria decreased to 1 g within 2 weeks of treatment.CONCLUSIONS: To the best of our knowledge, MCD has not been previously reported after receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine. It remains unclear whether the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are associated with the development of MCD, or it coincided with the mass vaccination. Further studies are needed to determine the incidence of MCD post COVID-19 vaccines and the underlying pathophysiology of glomerular injury post vaccination.",

However, there is still a growing need for bioscientists, from different backgrounds, with different levels, to acquire programming skills, which could reduce the time from data to insights and bridge communication between life scientists and computer scientists. Python is a programming language extensively used in bioinformatics and data science, which is particularly suitable for beginners. Here, we describe the conception, organization, and implementation of the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data. This workshop has been organized by graduate and undergraduate students and supported, mostly in administrative matters, by experienced faculty members since 2017. The workshop was conceived for teaching bioscientists, mainly students in Brazil, on how to program in a biological context. The goal of this article was to share our experience with the 2020 edition of the workshop in its virtual format due to the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic and to compare and contrast this year's experience with the previous in-person editions. We described a hands-on and live coding workshop model for teaching introductory Python programming. We also highlighted the adaptations made from in-person to online format in 2020, the participants' assessment of learning progression, and general workshop management. Lastly, we provided a summary and reflections from our personal experiences from the workshops of the last 4 years. Our takeaways included the benefits of the learning from learners' feedback (LLF) that allowed us to improve the workshop in real time, in the short, and likely in the long term. We concluded that the Brazilian Python Workshop for Biological Data is a highly effective workshop model for teaching a programming language that allows bioscientists to go beyond an initial exploration of programming skills for data analysis in the medium to long term.",

Regression analysis of near add power and age was analyzed to compare 2017 with later years up to the pandemic. The prevalence of dry eye-related signs and six common symptoms were compared.RESULTS: The number and mean age (y) of participants were 183 (48.6�4.1) in 2017, 46 (51.3�7.5) in 2019, and 110 (49.2�3.7) in 2020-21, respectively. The mean progression rate of near add power (D/y) was 0.13 for 2017, 0.09 for 2019 (P = 0.028, vs 2017), and 0.08 for 2020-21 (P<0.001, vs 2017). The slope (rate of presbyopia progression) became flatter from 2017 to 2021 and the estimated near add power at the age of 40 increased from 2017 to 2020-2021, implicating presbyopia developed earlier and worsened during the study period. The 2017 values were comparable with previous studies described in 1922 and 2019. The standardized correlation coefficient between age and near add power was 0.816 for 2017, 0.671 for 2019 (P = 0.084, vs 2017), and 0.572 for 2020-21 (P<0.001, vs 2017). Multiple regression analysis revealed age and COVID-19 pandemic were significantly correlated with near add power. The prevalence of dryness irritation, and pain was greater in 2020-21 than in 2017 with no difference in the prevalence of eye fatigue, blurring, and photophobia. There was no difference in the prevalence of short tear break-up time and positive corneal staining among 2017, 2019 and 2020-21.CONCLUSION: Estimated presbyopia developed earlier and progressed slower from 2017 to 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic. Stress and rapid digitalization related to strict infection control and quarantine might be contributing factors.",

Participants described the largely negative impact that the COVID-19 lockdown had on to health-related behaviours and access to healthcare, which had resulted in large declines in mental health and wellbeing. Participants also indicated disappointment at the UK Governments response and handling of the COVID-19 lockdown.IMPLICATIONS: This study provides novel evidence of the lived experience of the first COVID-19 lockdown for people identified as at high risk of severe illness. In the context of behavioural health interventions, the ubiquity of digital technologies and their adoption into day-to-day life translates into greater potential reach than traditional interventions, and consequently, greater potential for positive public health impact. Findings should be considered by policymakers and healthcare professionals to support people now and as we transition through the recovery phase with a particular emphasis on supporting mental health and changes to the management of long-term health conditions.",

In this proof-of-concept study, we explored the potential of targeted mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 proteins in both research samples and clinical specimens. First, we assessed the limit of detection for several SARS-CoV-2 proteins by parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) MS in infected Vero E6 cells. For tryptic peptides of Nucleocapsid protein, the limit of detection was estimated to be in the mid-attomole range (9E-13 g). Next, this PRM methodology was applied to the detection of viral proteins in various COVID-19 patient clinical specimens, such as sputum and nasopharyngeal swabs. SARS-CoV-2 proteins were detected in these samples with high sensitivity in all specimens with PCR Ct values <24 and in several samples with higher CT values. A clear relationship was observed between summed MS peak intensities for SARS-CoV-2 proteins and Ct values reflecting the abundance of viral RNA. Taken together, these results suggest that targeted MS based proteomics may have the potential to be used as an additional tool in COVID-19 diagnostics.",

This gap is addressed by the current study which draws from the Hungry Cities Partnership (HCP) city-wide household food insecurity survey of Nairobi city in Kenya. It uses both descriptive statistics and multilevel modelling using General Linear Mixed Models (GLMM) to examine the relationship between household food security and 16 different shocks experienced in the six months prior to the administration of the survey. The findings showed that only 29% of surveyed households were completely food secure. Of those experiencing some level of food insecurity, more experienced economic (55%) than sociopolitical (16%) and biophysical (10%) shocks. Economic shocks such as food price increases, loss of employment, and reduced income were all associated with increased food insecurity. Coupled with the lack of functioning social safety nets in Nairobi, households experiencing shocks and emergencies experience serious food insecurity and related health effects. In this context, the COVID-19 pandemic is likely to have a major negative economic impact on many vulnerable urban households. As such, there is need for new policies on urban food emergencies with a clear emergency preparedness plan for responding to major economic and other shocks that target the most vulnerable.",

This study jointly examined county-level racial/ethnic differences in compliance with stay-at-home orders and COVID-19 health outcomes during 2020, leveraging two-year geo-tracking data of mobile devices across ~4.4 million point-of-interests (POIs) in the contiguous United States. Through a set of structural equation modeling, this study quantified how racial/ethnic differences in following stay-at-home orders could mediate COVID-19 health outcomes, controlling for state effects, socioeconomics, demographics, occupation, and partisanship. Results showed that counties with higher Asian populations decreased most in their travel, both in terms of reducing their overall POIs' visiting and increasing their staying home percentage. Moreover, counties with higher White populations experienced the lowest infection rate, while counties with higher African American populations presented the highest case-fatality ratio. Additionally, control variables, particularly partisanship, median household income, percentage of elders, and urbanization, significantly accounted for the county differences in human mobility and COVID-19 health outcomes. Mediation analyses further revealed that human mobility only statistically influenced infection rate but not case-fatality ratio, and such mediation effects varied substantially among racial/ethnic compositions. Last, robustness check of racial gradient at census block group level documented consistent associations but greater magnitude. Taken together, these findings suggest that US residents' responses to COVID-19 are subject to an entrenched and consequential racial/ethnic divide.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) positivity ratio and distribution of viral loads within a cohort of asymptomatic patients screened prior hospitalization or surgery, stratified by age category.MATERIALS/METHODS: We retrospectively studied data on SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR detection in respiratory tract samples of asymptomatic patients screened pre-hospitalization or pre-surgery in nine Belgian hospitals located in Flanders over a 12-month period (1 April 2020-31 March 2021).RESULTS: In total, 255925 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test results and 2421 positive results for which a viral load was reported, were included in this study. An unweighted overall SARS-CoV-2 real-time RT-PCR positivity ratio of 1.27% was observed with strong spatiotemporal differences. SARS-CoV-2 circulated predominantly in 80+ year old individuals across all time periods except between the first and second COVID-19 wave and in 20-30 year old individuals before the second COVID-19 wave. In contrast to the first wave, a significantly higher positivity ratio was observed for the 20-40 age group in addition to the 80+ age group compared to the other age groups during the second wave. The median viral load follows a similar temporal evolution as the positivity rate with an increase ahead of the second wave and highest viral loads observed for 80+ year old individuals.CONCLUSION: There was a high SARS-CoV-2 circulation among asymptomatic patients with a predominance and highest viral loads observed in the elderly. Moreover, ahead of the second COVID-19 wave an increase in median viral load was noted with the highest overall positivity ratio observed in 20-30 year old individuals, indicating they could have been the hidden drivers of this wave.",

Curbing the spread of COVID-19 requires restrictions in these public spaces, however, the compliance to these measures depends largely on the understanding and interpretations of COVID 19 by users of these public spaces. This study examined the contextual interpretations of public space users about COVID-19 prevention in Ibadan Metropolis, Oyo State. The study was a rapid ethnographic survey in selected public spaces (markets and commercial motor parks) in Ibadan metropolis. Data were collected through participant observation, key informant interviews (3 females; 3 males) and in-depth interviews (30) with, traders, head porters, clients/buyers and commercial vehicle drivers in these public spaces. Interviews conducted were transcribed, sorted into themes using Atlas-ti 7.5.7 and subjected to interpretive-content analysis. Findings revealed that some respondents felt COVID-19 was brought into Nigeria by rich frequent global voyagers, others felt it was through \"uncultured\" sexual life or wrath of God. Some also doubted the existence of the disease and many of the respondents perceived COVID-19 as a disease reported by the government or a political propaganda to siphon funds. The users of the public spaces in Ibadan Metropolis have variegated perception about the existence and severity of this rapidly spreading virus and this has grave implications for COVID-19 control in the State. Thus, regular interaction with public space users are essential for control efforts.",

We aimed to examine suicide rates among minority ethnic psychiatric patients and describe their social and clinical characteristics.METHODS: We did a retrospective observational cohort study on a national case-series of patients in England and Wales who died by suicide within 12 months of contact with mental health services between 2007 and 2018. Data were collected as part of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Safety in Mental Health. Suicide rates and standardised mortality ratios (SMRs) were estimated for South Asian (Indian, Pakistani, and Bangladeshi), Black African, Black Caribbean, Chinese, and White patients.FINDINGS: A total of 698 patients in the four minority ethnic groups of South Asian, Black Caribbean, Black African, and Chinese were included (482 [69%] men; 216 [31%] women; mean age 41 years [SD 14�9, range 12-91] and compared with 13 567 White patients (9030 [66�6%] men; 4537 [33�4%] women; mean age 48 years [SD 15�8, range 10-100]). Rates and SMRs for suicide among minority ethnic patients were lower than for White patients (2�73 deaths, 95% CI 2�68-2�78) per 100 000 population. Differences were found between ethnic groups with higher suicide rates in Black Caribbean patients (1�89 deaths [95% CI 1�55-2�23] per 100 000 population) and lower rates in South Asian patients (1�49 deaths [1�33-1�64] per 100 000 population). There was an increase in rates among White patients in 2007-12 followed by a fall but no change among other ethnic groups. Schizophrenia was more common among Black African patients (54%) and Black Caribbean patients (44%), while affective disorder was more common among South Asian patients (41%). Minority ethnic patients overall showed markers of social adversity and received higher intensity care yet were viewed by clinicians as at lower risk than White patients.INTERPRETATION: Effective approaches to prevention might differ between minority ethnic groups. Clinicians and the services in which they work should be aware of the common and distinct social and clinical needs of minority ethnic patients with mental illness.FUNDING: The Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership.",

Genome-wide association study (GWAS) signals in 11 loci colocalize with expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) associated with the expression of 20 genes in 62 tissues/cell types (range: 1:43 tissues/gene), including lung, brain, heart, muscle, and skin as well as the digestive system and immune system. We perform genetic fine mapping to compute 99% credible SNP sets, which identify 10 GWAS loci that have eight or fewer SNPs in the credible set, including three loci with one single likely causal SNP. Our study suggests that the diverse symptoms and disease severity of COVID-19 observed between individuals is associated with variants across the genome, affecting gene expression levels in a wide variety of tissue types.",

Although numerous meta-analyses and systematic reviews have been conducted on gratitude intervention, no studies have focused on the working population. This study aimed to systematically summarize the effectiveness of gratitude interventions on workers' mental health and well-being.METHODS: Systematic search was conducted in February 2021 using five databases. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials implementing gratitude activities among healthy workers and measuring mental health or well-being indicators and original articles or thesis in English.RESULTS: Nine out of 1957 articles met the inclusion criteria. Eight studies adopted gratitude list interventions, showing a significant improvement in perceived stress and depression; however, the effects on well-being were inconsistent. Interventions with gratitude list four times or less did not report significant changes in any outcomes.CONCLUSIONS: Most gratitude interventions incorporated a gratitude list, and some studies included gratitude activities as a part of the combined program. On the other hand, no studies focused on only behavioral gratitude expression among workers. Gratitude interventions might be effective in improving mental health, but their effects on well-being remain unclear. The total number of gratitude lists and reflections might influence the effect on mental health and well-being; however, due to the high heterogeneity of the studies, further studies are needed.",

PHC participants were defined as those who underwent PHCs for the first three consecutive waves, and we investigated the onset of inpatient care for five types of non-communicable diseases (diabetes, heart disease, stroke, hypertension, and dyslipidemia) as well as poor self-rated health and problems in the activities of daily living in the subsequent 11 waves. Cox-proportional hazards models were used to estimate the impact of PHCs on health outcomes by employing the propensity score matching (PSM) method.RESULTS: Participation in PHCs was closely related to a respondent's socioeconomic status and health behavior. After controlling for these factors by PSM, the hazard models showed that PHCs postponed the onset of inpatient care for hypertension (hazard ratio, 0.56; 95% confidence interval: 0.36-0.85) among men, but PHCs had no impact on any other health outcomes in men or women.CONCLUSIONS: The preventive impact of PHCs on health deterioration is generally limited among middle-aged adults. Future studies should address policy measures to enhance the effectiveness of PHCs.",

We investigated the association between health-related behaviors and odds of hospitalization for COVID-19 in a cohort of military personnel.METHODS: This case-controlled study compared all active-duty US Air Force service members hospitalized for COVID-19 between March 5, 2020, and March 10, 2021 (cases), with their geographically matched peers who had COVID-19 and were treated as outpatients (controls). We used logistic regression to compare cases and controls according to self-reported sleep duration, physical activity, dietary factors, binge alcohol consumption, and tobacco use - with and without adjustment for sociodemographic factors, body mass index, physical fitness level, pertinent disease history, and psychological distress - resulting in crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) with 95% CIs. The trend between sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption and hospitalization odds was assessed by using the Cochran-Armitage test.RESULTS: Ninety-three hospitalized cases were matched to 372 ambulatory controls. Adjusting for baseline characteristics and other health-related behaviors, cases were more likely than controls to report fewer than 7 hours of sleep, compared with 7 to 9 hours (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.07-3.16), and were more likely than controls to consume 3 or more SSBs per week, compared with fewer than 3 SSBs (OR = 1.74; 95% CI, 1.03-2.92). In a dose-response relationship, higher SSB consumption was associated with greater odds of being hospitalized (P value for trend = .02).CONCLUSION: Interventions that address short sleep duration and SSB consumption may reduce morbidity from COVID-19 among military service members and potentially in the broader US population.",

However, the association of socioeconomic determinants with racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes remains unclear.Objective: To evaluate the association of race and ethnicity with COVID-19 outcomes and to examine the association between race, ethnicity, COVID-19 outcomes, and socioeconomic determinants.Data Sources: A systematic search of PubMed, medRxiv, bioRxiv, Embase, and the World Health Organization COVID-19 databases was performed for studies published from January 1, 2020, to January 6, 2021.Study Selection: Studies that reported data on associations between race and ethnicity and COVID-19 positivity, disease severity, and socioeconomic status were included and screened by 2 independent reviewers. Studies that did not have a satisfactory quality score were excluded. Overall, less than 1% (0.47%) of initially identified studies met selection criteria.Data Extraction and Synthesis: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. Associations were assessed using adjusted and unadjusted risk ratios (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs), combined prevalence, and metaregression. Data were pooled using a random-effects model.Main Outcomes and Measures: The main measures were RRs, ORs, and combined prevalence values.Results: A total of 4 318 929 patients from 68 studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, 370 933 patients (8.6%) were African American, 9082 (0.2%) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 101 793 (2.4%) were Asian American, 851 392 identified as Hispanic/Latino (19.7%), 7417 (0.2%) were Pacific Islander, 1 037 996 (24.0%) were White, and 269 040 (6.2%) identified as multiracial and another race or ethnicity. In age- and sex-adjusted analyses, African American individuals (RR, 3.54; 95% CI, 1.38-9.07; P = .008) and Hispanic individuals (RR, 4.68; 95% CI, 1.28-17.20; P = .02) were the most likely to test positive for COVID-19. Asian American individuals had the highest risk of intensive care unit admission (RR, 1.93; 95% CI, 1.60-2.34, P < .001). The area deprivation index was positively correlated with mortality rates in Asian American and Hispanic individuals (P < .001). Decreased access to clinical care was positively correlated with COVID-19 positivity in Hispanic individuals (P < .001) and African American individuals (P < .001).Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, members of racial and ethnic minority groups had higher risks of COVID-19 positivity and disease severity. Furthermore, socioeconomic determinants were strongly associated with COVID-19 outcomes in racial and ethnic minority populations.",

By replacing the VSV glycoprotein with the spikes (S) of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, we generated two replication-competent recombinant viruses, rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 and rVSV-SARS-CoV. Using wild-type and human ACE2 (hACE2) knock-in mouse models, we found a single dose of rVSV-SARS-CoV could elicit strong humoral immune response via both intranasal (i.n.) and intramuscular (i.m.) routes. Despite the high genetic similarity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, no obvious cross-neutralizing activity was observed in the immunized mice sera. In macaques, neutralizing antibody (NAb) titers induced by one i.n. dose of rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 were eight-fold higher than those by a single i.m. dose. Thus, our data indicates that rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 might be suitable for i.n. administration instead of the traditional i.m. immunization in human. Because rVSV-SARS-CoV elicited significantly stronger NAb responses than rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 in a route-independent manner, we generated a chimeric antigen by replacing the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV S with that from the SARS-CoV-2. rVSV expressing the chimera (rVSV-SARS-CoV/2-RBD) induced significantly increased NAbs against SARS-CoV-2 in mice and macaques than rVSV-SARS-CoV-2, with a safe Th1-biased response. Serum immunized with rVSV-SARS-CoV/2-RBD showed no cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV. hACE2 mice receiving a single i.m. dose of either rVSV-SARS-CoV-2 or rVSV-SARS-CoV/2-RBD were fully protected against SARS-CoV-2 challenge without obvious lesions in the lungs. Our results suggest that transplantation of SARS-CoV-2 RBD into the S protein of SARS-CoV might be a promising antigen design for COVID-19 vaccines.",

We undertook this study to evaluate the inter-test agreement and other key operational features of 5 such commercial kits that have been extensively used in India for routine diagnostic testing for COVID-19. The five commercial kits were evaluated, using a panel of positive and negative respiratory samples, considering the kit provided by National Institute of Virology, Indian Council of Medical Research (2019-nCoV Kit) as the reference. The positive panel comprised of individuals who fulfilled the 3 criteria of being clinically symptomatic, having history of contact with diagnosed cases and testing positive in the reference kit. The negative panel included both healthy and disease controls, the latter being drawn from individuals diagnosed with other respiratory viral infections. The same protocol of sample collection, same RNA extraction kit and same RT-PCR instrument were used for all the kits. Clinical samples were collected from a panel of 92 cases and 60 control patients, who fulfilled our inclusion criteria. The control group included equal number of healthy individuals and patients infected with other respiratory viruses (n = 30, in each group). We observed varying sensitivity and specificity among the evaluated kits, with LabGun COVID-19 RT-PCR kit showing the highest sensitivity and specificity (94% and 100% respectively), followed by TaqPath COVID-19 Combo and Allplex 2019-nCoV assays. The extent of inter-test agreement was not associated with viral loads of the samples. Poor correlation was observed between Ct values of the same genes amplified using different kits. Our findings reveal the presence of wide heterogeneity and sub-optimal inter-test agreement in the diagnostic performance of the evaluated kits and hint at the need of adopting stringent standards for fulfilling the quality assurance requirements of the COVID-19 diagnostic process.",

Due to the potential increase in ADHD severity during and post the COVID-19 pandemic, we analyzed recent national and two state-specific ADHD data distribution among U.S. children and adolescents by investigating a broad range of socioeconomic status (SES) factors. Child and adolescent ADHD diagnosis and treatment data were parent-reported via National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH). The nationwide childhood prevalence of ADHD is 8.7%, and 62.1% of diagnosed children are taking medication. Louisiana (15.7%) has the highest percentage of children diagnosed with ADHD and California (5.6%) has the lowest, followed by Nevada (5.9%). Multiple correspondence analysis (MCA, n = 51,939) examining 30 factors highlights four areas of interest at the national and state level: race/ethnicity, financial status, family structure, and neighborhood characteristics. Positive correlations between ADHD diagnosis and unsafe school, unsafe neighborhood, and economic hardship are evident nationally and statewide, while the association between a lack of ADHD diagnosis and higher urban neighborhood amenities are evident nationally, but not in two opposing outlier states-Louisiana or Nevada. National and state-specific hierarchical analyses demonstrate significant correlations between the various SES factors and ADHD outcomes. Since the national analysis does not account for the demographic heterogeneity within regions or individual states, the U.S. should rely on comprehensive, county-specific, near real-time data reporting to effectively model and mitigate the ADHD epidemic and similar national health crises.",

This zoonotic-enveloped virus is primarily transmitted through inhalation. Infected people are commonly asymptomatic or manifest mild symptoms, including fever, cough, diarrhea, and fatigue. However, it may lead to severe patterns associated with multiple organ failure in individuals with an impaired immune system.OBJECTIVE: Here we report a 7-year-old girl with hyper-immunoglobulin M (IgM) (HIgM) phenotype, admitted to the hospital emergency department with fever, cough, and pneumonia symptoms because of the COVID-19 infection. Coronavirus infection was confirmed by a positive real-time polymerase chain reaction test. Surprisingly, serum levels of both IgG and IgA of the patient were transiently normalized during the COVID-19 infection when tested prior to the monthly injection of intravenous immunoglobulin. After she recovered from the COVID infection, her immunoglobulin levels returned to the primary stage and she demonstrated HIgM phenotype.CONCLUSION: Since this transient increase in the levels of immunoglobulins was solely observed during the COVID-19 infection, and no other infectious episodes were diagnosed in the patient, clarifying the exact cause would help to understand in a better manner the implications and specification of humoral immunity in patients with primary antibody deficiencies.",

Novel vaccines are based on a messenger RNA (mRNA) motif with a lipid nanoparticle (LNP) vector, consisting of high content of unique pH-sensitive ionizable lipids (ILs). Here we provide molecular insights into the role of the ILs and lipid mixtures used in current mRNA vaccines. We observed that the lipid mixtures adopted a nonlamellar organization, with ILs separating into a very disordered, pH-sensitive phase. We describe structural differences of the two ILs leading to their different congregation, with implications for the vaccine stability. Finally, as RNA interacts preferentially with IL-rich phases located at the regions with high curvature of lipid phase, local changes in RNA flexibility and base pairing are induced by lipids. A proper atomistic understanding of RNA-lipid interactions may enable rational tailoring of LNP composition for efficient RNA delivery.",

We aimed to examine associated factors of fear of COVID-19, anxiety and depression among pregnant women during the pandemic where the impacts of healthy eating behaviour (HES) and health literacy (HL) were emphasized.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted between 14 February 2020 and 31 May 2020 in 18 health centres and hospitals across Vietnam. Data of 518 pregnant women were analysed, including socio-demographics, pregnant-related factors, HES, HL, health-related behaviours, fear of COVID-19 scale (FCoV-19S), anxiety (using the generalized anxiety disorder (GAD-7)) and depression (using the patient health questionnaire with 9 items (PHQ-9)). Regression analysis was utilized to explore the associations.RESULTS: Pregnant women with higher scores of HES and HL had lower likelihood of anxiety (odds ratio, OR, 0.79; 95% confidence interval (95%CI), 0.73, 0.87; p < .001; and OR, 0.94; 95%CI, 0.90, 0.99; p = .018) and depression (OR, 0.84; 95%CI, 0.78, 0.91; p < .001; and OR, 0.96; 95%CI, 0.91, 0.99; p = .044), respectively. Pregnant women being employed had a lower FCoV-19S score (regression coefficient, B, -1.46; 95%CI, -2.51, -0.40; p = .007). Besides, other significant predictors of anxiety were eating healthier during the pandemic, unchanged or more physical activity, elevated gestational age and smoking. Other significant predictors of depression were eating healthier during the pandemic, elevated gestational age and smoking.CONCLUSIONS: Among others, HES and HL had positive impacts on protecting pregnant women against anxiety and depression. Improving HES and HL should be addressed as a strategic approach to improve reproductive health during the pandemic.KEY MESSAGEThe COVID-19 pandemic influences antenatal mental disorders with the higher level as opposed to that before the pandemic.Healthy eating behaviour and better health literacy (HL) had critical roles in lowering prenatal anxiety and depression during the COVID-19 crisis.Strategic approaches for improving healthy eating and HL should be recommended for protecting pregnant women from mental health problems during the pandemic.",

Demographics, clinical features, type of immunosuppressive treatment, suspected or confirmed COVID-19 in the patients or cohabitants, and changes in care delivery were recorded.RESULTS: One hundred fifty-three children were included: 84 (55%) female, median age 13 years (interquartile range [8-16] years), 79 (52%) on immunosuppressive treatment. COVID-19 was suspected or confirmed in 17 (11%) (all mild), with a frequency similar in patients with and without immunosuppressive treatment (11/79 [14%] vs 6/74 [8%], p = 0.3085). The frequency of neurologic relapses was similar in patients with (18%) and without (21%) COVID-19. Factors associated with COVID-19 included having cohabitants with COVID-19 (p < 0.001) and lower blood levels of vitamin D (p = 0.039). Return to face-to-face schooling or mask type did not influence the risk of infection, although 43(28%) children had contact with a classmate with COVID-19. Clinic visits changed from face to face to remote for 120 (79%) patients; 110 (92%) were satisfied with the change.DISCUSSION: In this cohort of children with neuroimmunologic disorders, the frequency of COVID-19 was low and not affected by immunosuppressive therapies. The main risk factors for developing COVID-19 were having cohabitants with COVID-19 and low vitamin D levels.",

The study was designed to identify and compare the value of fMRI parameters in predicting early response to IC in patients with NPC.METHODS: This prospective study enrolled fifty-six consecutively NPC patients treated with IC from January 2021 to May 2021. Conventional diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI), intravoxel incoherent motion (IVIM) and dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) protocols were performed before and after IC. Parameters maps (ADC, MD, MK, Dslow, Dfast, PF, Ktrans, Ve and Kep) of the primary tumor were calculated by the Functool post-processing software. The participants were classified as responding group (RG) and non-responding group (NRG) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 1.1. The fMRI parameters were compared before and after IC and between RG with NRG. Logistic regression analysis and ROC were performed to further identify and compare the efficacy of the parameters.RESULTS: After IC, the mean values of ADC(p < 0.001), MD(p < 0.001), Dslow(p = 0.001), PF(p = 0.030) and Ve(p = 0.003) significantly increased, while MK(p < 0.001), Dfast(p = 0.009) and Kep(p = 0.003) values decreased dramatically, while no significant difference was detected in Ktrans(p = 0.130). Compared with NRG, ADC-pre(p < 0.001), MD-pre(p < 0.001) and Dslow-pre(p = 0.002) values in RG were lower, while MK-pre(p = 0.017) values were higher. The areas under the ROC curves for the ADC-pre, MD-pre, MK-pre, Dslow-pre and PRE were 0.885, 0.855, 0.809, 0.742 and 0.912, with the optimal cutoff value of 1210 ? 10- 6 mm2/s, 1010 ? 10- 6 mm2/s, 832 ? 10- 6, 835 ? 10- 6 mm2/s and 0.799 respectively.CONCLUSIONS: The pretreatment conventional DWI (ADC), DKI (MD and MK), and IVIM (Dslow) values derived from fMRI showed a promising potential in predicting the response of the primary tumor to IC in NPC patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was approved by ethics board of the Chinese PLA General Hospital, and registered on January 30, 2021, in Chinese Clinical Trial Registry ( ChiCTR2100042863 ).",

Secondary outcomes included differences in standard deviation scores in English (16 and 11 years) and mathematics (11 years). Analysis was by intention to treat with multiple imputation for participants missing the primary outcome.RESULTS: 1607 (91.2%) participants were linked to school records. No benefit was found for performance in mathematics examinations at age 16 years for any modified formula: nutrient enriched in preterm infants after discharge from hospital, standard deviation score 0.02 (95% confidence interval -0.22 to 0.27), and nutrient enriched in small for gestational age term infants -0.11 (-0.33 to 0.12); LCPUFA supplemented in preterm infants -0.19 (-0.46 to 0.08) and in term infants -0.14 (-0.36 to 0.08); iron follow-on formula in term infants -0.12 (-0.31 to 0.07); and sn-2 palmitate supplemented formula in term infants -0.09 (-0.37 to 0.19). Participants from the nucleotide trial were too young to have sat their General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) examinations at the time of linkage to school data. Secondary outcomes did not differ for nutrient enriched, high iron, sn-2 palmitate, or nucleotide supplemented formulas, but at 11 years, preterm and term participants randomised to LCPUFA supplemented formula scored lower in English and mathematics.CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from these randomised controlled trials indicated that the infant formula modifications did not promote long term cognitive benefit compared with standard infant formulas.",

        "abstractText": "Complement evasion is a hallmark of extracellular microbial pathogens such as Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. Lyme disease spirochetes express nearly a dozen outer surface lipoproteins that bind complement components and interfere with their native activities. Among these, BBK32 is unique in its selective inhibition of the classical pathway. BBK32 blocks activation of this pathway by selectively binding and inhibiting the C1r serine protease of the first component of complement, C1. To understand the structural basis for BBK32-mediated C1r inhibition, we performed crystallography and size-exclusion chromatography-coupled small angle X-ray scattering experiments, which revealed a molecular model of BBK32-C in complex with activated human C1r. Structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis was combined with surface plasmon resonance binding experiments and assays of complement function to validate the predicted molecular interface. Analysis of the structures shows that BBK32 inhibits activated forms of C1r by occluding substrate interaction subsites (i.e., S1 and S1') and reveals a surprising role for C1r B loop-interacting residues for full inhibitory activity of BBK32. The studies reported in this article provide for the first time (to our knowledge) a structural basis for classical pathway-specific inhibition by a human pathogen.",

Previous studies showed that the ability of ASFV to antagonize IFN production is closely related to its pathogenicity. Here, we report that ASFV HLJ/18 infection induced low levels of type I IFN and inhibited cGMP-AMP-induced type I IFN production in porcine alveolar macrophages that were isolated from specific pathogen-free Landrace piglets. Subsequently, an unbiased screen was performed to screen the ASFV genes with inhibitory effects on the type I IFN production. ASFV pI215L, a viral E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, was identified as one of the strongest inhibitory effectors on the production of type I IFN. Knockdown of pI215L expression inhibited ASFV replication and enhanced IFN-� production. However, inhibition of type I IFN production by pI215L was independent of its E2 enzyme activity. Furthermore, we found that pI215L inhibited type I IFN production and K63-linked polyubiquitination of TANK-binding kinase 1 through pI215L-binding RING finger protein 138 (RNF138). ASFV pI215L enhanced the interaction between RNF138 and RNF128 and promoted RNF138 to degrade RNF128, which resulted in reduced K63-linked polyubiquitination of TANK-binding kinase 1 and type ? IFN production. Taken together, our findings reveal a novel immune escape mechanism of ASFV, which provides a clue to the design and development of an immune-sensitive attenuated live vaccine.",

A time dependent, propensity matched analysis was performed to adjust for confounding due to indication and evaluate the independent association of epinephrine before defibrillation with study outcomes.RESULTS: Among 34 820 patients with an initial shockable rhythm, 9630 (27.6%) were treated with epinephrine before defibrillation, contrary to current guidelines. In comparison with participants treated with defibrillation first, participants receiving epinephrine first were less likely to have a history of myocardial infarction or heart failure, but more likely to have renal failure, sepsis, pneumonia, and receive mechanical ventilation before in-hospital cardiac arrest (P<0.0001 for all). Treatment with epinephrine before defibrillation was strongly associated with delayed defibrillation (median 3 minutes v 0 minutes). In propensity matched analysis (9011 matched pairs), epinephrine before defibrillation was associated with lower odds of survival to discharge (25.2% v 29.9%; adjusted odds ratio 0.81, 95% confidence interval 0.74 to 0.88; P<0.001), favorable neurological survival (18.6% v 21.4%; 0.85, 0.76 to 0.92; P<0.001), and survival after acute resuscitation (64.4% v 69.4%; 0.76, 0.70 to 0.83; P<0.001). The above findings were consistent in a range of sensitivity analyses, including matching according to defibrillation time.CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to current guidelines that prioritize immediate defibrillation for in-hospital cardiac arrest due to a shockable rhythm, more than one in four patients are treated with epinephrine before defibrillation, which is associated with worse survival.",

Studies on the interferon-� (IFN-�)/ Janus kinase (JAK)/ signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)1 pathway provide new directions in this regard.METHODS: Our study applies three colon cancer cell lines, including microsatellite stable (MSS) cell lines, which are SW480 and SW620, and microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) cell line, which is DLD-1. We compared the expressions of immune surface markers on colon cancer cells in response to IFN-�. We elucidated these mechanisms, which involved the upregulation of immune surface markers. Furthermore, we examined real-world clinical samples using the PerkinElmer Opal multiplex system and NanoString analysis.RESULTS: We established that the baseline expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I alleles and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) were generally low in cell line models. The immune surface markers were significantly increased after IFN-� stimulation on SW480 but were notably unresponsive on the SW620 cell line. We discovered that STAT1 and phosphorylated STAT1 (pSTAT1) were downregulated in the SW620 cell line. We verified that the STAT1/pSTAT1 could be restored through the application of proteasome inhibitors, especially bortezomib. The expression of MHC class I as downstream signals of STAT1 was also up-regulated by proteasome inhibitors. The similar results were reproduced in DLD-1 cell line, which was also initially unresponsive to IFN-�. In real-world samples of patients with mCRC, we found that higher STAT1 expression in tumor cells was strongly indicative of a highly immunogenic microenvironment, with significantly higher expression levels of MHC class I and PD-L1, not only on tumor cells but also on non-tumor cells. Furthermore, tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) were increased in the positive-STAT1 group. Through NanoString analysis, we confirmed that the mRNA expressions of IFN-�, human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-A, HLA-E, and HLA-G were also significantly higher in the positive-STAT1 group than those in the negative-STAT1 group.CONCLUSION: Our study provides a novel rationale for the addition of bortezomib, a proteasome inhibitor, into new immunotherapy combinations.",

Investigations are needed to enable identification of CHD risk factors as studies have given conflicting results. This study aim was to identify maternal sociodemographic characteristics, behaviours, and birth outcomes as risk factors for CHD. This was a population based, data linkage cohort study using anonymised data from Northern Ireland (NI) covering the period 2010-2014. The study cohort composed of 94,067 live births with an outcome of 1162 cases of CHD using the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD)-10 codes and based on the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) grouping system for CHD. CHD cases were obtained from the HeartSuite database (HSD) at the Royal Belfast Hospital for Sick Children (RBHSC), maternal data were extracted from the Northern Ireland Maternity System (NIMATS), and medication data were extracted from the Enhanced Prescribing Database (EPD). STATA version 14 was used for the statistical analysis in this study, Odds Ratio (OR), 95% Confident intervals (CI), P value, and logistic regression were used in the analysis. Ethical approval was granted from the National Health Service (NHS) Research Ethics Committee.RESULT: In this study, a number of potential risk factors were assessed for statistically significant association with CHD, however only certain risk factors demonstrated a statistically significant association with CHD which included: gestational age at first booking (AOR = 1.21; 95% CI = 1.04-1.41; P < 0.05), family history of CHD or congenital abnormalities and syndromes (AOR = 4.14; 95% CI = 2.47-6.96; P < 0.05), woman's smoking in pregnancy (AOR = 1.22; 95% CI = 1.04-1.43; P < 0.05), preterm birth (AOR = 3.01; 95% CI = 2.44-3.01; P < 0.05), multiple births (AOR = 1.89; 95% CI = 1.58-2.60; P < 0.05), history of abortion (AOR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.03-1.28; P < 0.05), small for gestational age (SGA) (AOR = 1.44; 95% CI = 1.22-1.78; P < 0.05), and low birth weight (LBW) (AOR = 3.10; 95% CI = 2.22-3.55; P < 0.05). Prescriptions and redemptions of antidiabetic (AOR = 2.68; 95% CI = 1.85-3.98; P < 0.05), antiepileptic (AOR = 1.77; 95% CI = 1.10-2.81; P < 0.05), and dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors (DHFRI) (AOR = 2.13; 95% CI = 1.17-5.85; P < 0.05) in early pregnancy also showed evidence of statistically significant association with CHD.CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggested that there are certain maternal sociodemographic characteristics, behaviours and birth outcomes that are statistically significantly associated with higher risk of CHD. Appropriate prevention policy to target groups with higher risk for CHD may help to reduce CHD prevalence. These results are important for policy makers, obstetricians, cardiologists, paediatricians, midwives and the public.",

Upon severe COVID-19 and a lack of improvement after multidrug therapy and mechanical ventilation, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is introduced as the last option. Such treatment is critical in women with very preterm pregnancy when each additional day of the intrauterine stay is vital for the survival of the newborn.CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a 38-year-old woman at 27 weeks of gestation treated with multidrug therapy and ECMO. The woman was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with increasing fever, cough and dyspnoea. The course of the pregnancy was uncomplicated. She was otherwise healthy. At admission, she presented with severe dyspnoea, with oxygen saturation (SpO2) of 95% on passive oxygenation, heart rate of 145/min, and blood pressure of 145/90. After confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection, she received steroids, remdesivir and convalescent plasma therapy. The foetus was in good condition. No signs of an intrauterine infection were visible. Due to tachypnea of 40/min and SpO2 of 90%, the woman was intubated and mechanically ventilated. Due to circulatory failure, the prothrombotic activity of the coagulation system, further saturation worsening, and poor control of sedation, she was qualified for veno-venous ECMO. An elective caesarean section was performed at 29 weeks on ECMO treatment in the ICU. A preterm female newborn was delivered with an Apgar score of 7 and a birth weight of 1440 g. The newborn had no laboratory or clinical evidence of COVID-19. The placenta showed the following pathological changes: large subchorionic haematoma, maternal vascular malperfusion, marginal cord insertion, and chorangioma.CONCLUSIONS: This case presents the successful use of ECMO in a pregnant woman with acute respiratory distress syndrome in the course of severe COVID-19. Further research is required to explain the aetiology of placental disorders (e.g., maternal vascular malperfusion lesions or thrombotic influence of COVID-19). ECMO treatment in pregnant women remains challenging; thus, it should be used with caution. Long-term assessment may help to evaluate the safety of the ECMO procedure in pregnant women.",

Predictors for home delivery in the context of HIV have not been fully studied and understood in Northern Uganda. We therefore aimed to find out the incidence and risk factors for home delivery among women living with HIV in Lira, Northern Uganda.METHODS: This prospective cohort study was conducted between August 2018 and January 2020 in Lira district, Northern Uganda. A total of 505 HIV infected women receiving antenatal care at Lira regional referral hospital were enrolled consecutively and followed up at delivery. We used a structured questionnaire to obtain data on exposures which included: socio-demographic, reproductive-related and HIV-related characteristics. Data was analysed using Stata version 14.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, U.S.A.). We estimated adjusted risk ratios using Poisson regression models to ascertain risk factors for the outcome of interest which was home delivery (which is delivering an infant outside a health facility setting under the supervision of a non-health worker).RESULTS: The incidence of home delivery among women living with HIV was 6.9% (95%CI: 4.9-9.5%). Single women were more likely to deliver at home (adjusted risk ratio = 4.27, 95%CI: 1.66-11). Women whose labour started in the night (night time onset of labour ARR = 0.39, 95%CI: 0.18-0.86) and those that were adherent to their ART (ARR = 0.33, 95%CI: 0.13-0.86) were less likely to deliver at home.CONCLUSION: Home delivery remains high among women living with HIV especially those that do not have a partner.

The purpose of this study is to measure the prevalence of and explore risk factors associated with antenatal depressive symptoms in Galle, Sri Lanka.METHODS: This study used a mixed-method approach. The quantitative portion included 505 pregnant women from Galle, Sri Lanka, with health record data, responses to psychometric questionnaires (MSPSS and PRAQ-R2), and antenatal depression screening (EPDS). The qualitative portion included interviews with public health midwives about their experiences and routine clinical practices with women with antenatal depressive symptoms.RESULTS: Prevalence of antenatal depressive symptoms was 7.5%, highest in women over the age of 30 (13.0%, OR = 3.88, 95%CI = 1.71 - 9.97), with diabetes (21.9%, OR = 3.99, 95%CI = 1.50 - 9.56), or pre-eclampsia in a previous pregnancy (19.4%, OR = 3.32, 95%CI = 1.17 - 8.21). Lower prevalence was observed in the primiparous (3.3%, OR = 0.29, 95%CI = 0.12 - 0.64) employed outside the home (3.6%, OR = 0.33, 95%CI = 0.13 - 0.72), or upper-middle class (2.3%, OR = 0.17, 95%CI = 0.04 - 0.56). Anxiety levels were elevated in depressed women (OR = 1.13, 95%CI = 1.07 - 1.20), while perceived social support was lower (OR = 0.91, 95%CI = 0.89 - 0.93). After multivariable adjustment, only parity (OR = 0.20, 95%CI 0.05 - 0.74) and social support from a \"special person\" (OR = 0.94, 95%CI = 0.77 - 0.95) remained significantly associated with depressive symptoms. Qualitative findings also identified antenatal health problems and poor social support as risk factors for depressive symptoms. They also identified different contributing factors to poor mental health based on ethnicity, higher stress levels among women working outside the home, and misinformation about health conditions as a cause of poor mental health.CONCLUSIONS: Prevalence of antenatal depressive symptoms in Galle is lower than the recorded prevalence in other regions of Sri Lanka. Risk factors for antenatal depressive symptoms were identified on biological, psychological, and social axes.

Everyday lifestyle changes and antenatal care inaccessibility during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic have variable results that affect pregnancy outcomes. This study aimed to assess the alterations in stillbirth, neonatal-perinatal mortality, preterm birth, and birth weight during the COVID-19 national lockdown.METHODS: We used the data from the Jordan stillbirths and neonatal death surveillance system to compare pregnancy outcomes (gestational age, birth weight, small for gestational age, stillbirth, neonatal death, and perinatal death) between two studied periods (11 months before the pandemic (May 2019 to March 2020) vs. 9 months during the pandemic (April 2020 to March 1st 2020). Separate multinomial logistic and binary logistic regression models were used to compare the studied outcomes between the two studied periods after adjusting for the effects of mother's age, income, education, occupation, nationality, health sector, and multiplicity.RESULTS: There were 31106 registered babies during the study period; among them, 15311 (49.2%) and 15795 (50.8%) births occurred before and during the COVID-19 lockdown, respectively. We found no significant differences in preterm birth and stillbirth rates, neonatal mortality, or perinatal mortality before and during the COVID-19 lockdown. Our findings report a significantly lower incidence of extreme low birth weight (ELBW) infants (<1kg) during the COVID-19 lockdown period than that before the lockdown (adjusted OR 0.39, 95% CI 0.3-0.5: P value <0.001) CONCLUSIONS: During the COVID-19 lockdown period, the number of infants born with extreme low birth weight (ELBW) decreased significantly. More research is needed to determine the impact of cumulative socio-environmental and maternal behavioral changes that occurred during the pandemic on the factors that contribute to ELBW infants.",

Lower uterine segment hemorrhage during cesarean section is an important cause of postpartum hemorrhage. Our objective is to expore the efficacy and safety of King's combined uterine suture for hemostasis during cesarean section.METHODS: We examined 48 cases: 16 cases of pernicious placenta previa (including one case of twins), 11 cases of central placenta previa (including one case of twins), 18 cases of uterine scarring (including two cases of twins), as well as one case of twin pregnancy, two cases of breech presentation, and one case of pulmonary hypertension. The \"King's combined uterine suture\" method for hemostasis was used in patients with lower uterine segment hemorrhage during cesarean section.RESULTS: The results showed that all patients had successful hemostasis during surgery, and there were no cases of hysterectomy.CONCLUSION: We have concluded that King's combined uterine suture is a fast and safe hemostasis method for cesarean section that can effectively reduce blood loss and restore the normal shape of the lower uterine segment. Furthermore, this suture method can reduce postpartum hemorrhage and hysterectomy rate, as well as improve maternal prognosis.",

In this commentary, we describe how current policies create and maintain fatal barriers to methadone treatment for people in rural communities who have opioid use disorder, and highlight how COVID-19 adaptations and more flexible methadone models in other countries can better allow for effective and accessible care. Reasons and ways to address these issues to create lasting solutions for rural communities are discussed.LESSONS LEARNED: We focus on three lessons: (1) methadone dispensing and take-home schedules during COVID-19, (2) telehealth services during COVID-19, and (3) international models in use prior to COVID-19. We then outline recommendations for each lesson to improve access to methadone treatment long term for rural communities in the USA. There is an urgent need to implement recommendations that maintain flexible approaches and address methadone treatment barriers in the rural USA. To achieve lasting health policy change and combat stigma about addiction and methadone treatment, there is a need for advocacy efforts that give voice to rural residents impacted by inequitable access to methadone treatment and rural-tailored educational initiatives that promote the evidence base for methadone. We hope opioid treatment program directors, regulatory authorities, and health policymakers consider our recommendations.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic interrupted youth sports and left many children unable to train in-person with teammates and coaches. Given the large impact sports and physical activity have on the lives of children and adolescents, the effect that coronavirus disease 2019 restrictions have had on the psychological and physical well-being of young athletes is significant. The youth sports community has worked hard to find creative ways to safely bring children and adolescents back to the fields and courts with rules and regulations in place. Youth practices and competitions are potential spreader events for SARS-CoV-2, especially given the challenge of identifying young athletes and other participants with asymptomatic active viral infection. With the implementation of rapid result testing programs and the US Food and Drug Administration approval of a highly effective vaccine in adolescents and, most recently, in younger children, youth sports are once again becoming a place for young athletes to train, socialize, and learn invaluable lessons in teamwork and leadership.

We aimed to assess whether next-generation sequencing studies using the Tempus xO assay assessing mutations in 1711 cancer-related genes and performing whole transcriptome mRNA sequencing for structural alterations could improve diagnostic agreement and accuracy in assessing neoplasms with Spitzoid histologic features. Twenty expert pathologists were asked to review 70 consultation level cases with Spitzoid features, once with limited clinical information and again with additional genomic information. There was an improvement in overall agreement with additional genomic information. Most significantly, there was increase in agreement of the diagnosis of conventional melanoma from moderate (�=0.470, SE=0.0105) to substantial (�=0.645, SE=0.0143) as measured by an average Cohen �. Clinical follow-up was available in all 70 cases which substantiated that the improved agreement was clinically significant. Among 3 patients with distant metastatic disease, there was a highly significant increase in diagnostic recognition of the cases as conventional melanoma with genomics (P<0.005). In one case, none of 20 pathologists recognized a tumor with BRAF and TERT promoter mutations associated with fatal outcome as a conventional melanoma when only limited clinical information was provided, whereas 60% of pathologists correctly diagnosed this case when genomic information was also available. There was also a significant improvement in agreement of which lesions should be classified in the Spitz category/WHO Pathway from an average Cohen � of 0.360 (SE=0.00921) to 0.607 (SE=0.0232) with genomics.",

Adolescent girls and young women in sub-Saharan Africa account for a disproportionate number of new HIV infections compared with their male peers (1). The DREAMS (Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe) program includes multisectoral, layered interventions aimed at reducing factors that contribute to vulnerability to HIV infection among adolescent girls and young women in PEPFAR-supported sub-Saharan African countries (1). Namibia, a southern African country with a population of approximately 2.55 million among whom approximately 8% live with HIV infection, had their DREAMS program first implemented in 2017* (2,3). Data from the 2019 Namibia Violence Against Children and Youth Survey (VACS), the most recent and comprehensive nationally representative data source available to study the epidemiology of violence and other HIV risk factors, were used to estimate the percentage of adolescent girls and young women aged 13-24 years who would be eligible for DREAMS program services. The prevalence of individual DREAMS eligibility criteria, which comprise known age-specific risk factors associated with HIV acquisition, were estimated by age group. Among all adolescent girls and young women in Namibia, 62% were eligible for DREAMS based on meeting at least one criterion. Common eligibility criteria included adverse childhood experiences, specifically exposure to physical, emotional, and sexual violence and being an orphan;† and high-risk behaviors, such as early alcohol use,� recent heavy alcohol use,� and infrequent condom use.** Using VACS data to estimate the prevalence of HIV risk factors and identify adolescent girls and young women at elevated risk for HIV acquisition in countries like Namibia with high HIV-incidence can inform programs and policies aimed at improving the well-being of these adolescent girls and young women and help control the HIV epidemics in these countries.",

As the United States enters the 2021-22 influenza season, the potential impact of influenza illnesses is of concern given that influenza season will again coincide with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which could further strain overburdened health care systems. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine annual influenza vaccination for the 2021-22 influenza season for all persons aged ?6 months who have no contraindications (2). To assess the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on influenza vaccination coverage, the percentage change between administration of at least 1 dose of influenza vaccine during September-December 2020 was compared with the average administered in the corresponding periods in 2018 and 2019. The data analyzed were reported from 11 U.S. jurisdictions with high-performing state immunization information systems.* Overall, influenza vaccine administration was 9.0% higher in 2020 compared with the average in 2018 and 2019, combined. However, in 2020, the number of influenza vaccine doses administered to children aged 6-23 months and children aged 2-4 years, was 13.9% and 11.9% lower, respectively than the average for each age group in 2018 and 2019. Strategic efforts are needed to ensure high influenza vaccination coverage among all age groups, especially children aged 6 months-4 years who are not yet eligible to receive a COVID-19 vaccine.

However, the effect of BCG vaccination on the conventional adaptive immune cells subsets is not well characterized. We investigated the impact of BCG vaccination on the frequencies of T cell subsets and common gamma c (�c) cytokines in a group of healthy elderly individuals (age 60-80 years) at one month post vaccination as part of our clinical study to examine the effect of BCG on COVID-19. Our results demonstrate that BCG vaccination induced enhanced frequencies of central (p<0.0001) and effector memory (p<0.0001) CD4+ T cells and diminished frequencies of na?ve (p<0.0001), transitional memory (p<0.0001), stem cell memory (p = 0.0001) CD4+ T cells and regulatory T cells. In addition, BCG vaccination induced enhanced frequencies of central (p = 0.0008), effector (p<0.0001) and terminal effector memory (p<0.0001) CD8+ T cells and diminished frequencies of na?ve (p<0.0001), transitional memory (p<0.0001) and stem cell memory (p = 0.0034) CD8+T cells. BCG vaccination also induced enhanced plasma levels of IL-7 (p<0.0001) and IL-15 (p = 0.0020) but diminished levels of IL-2 (p = 0.0033) and IL-21 (p = 0.0020). Thus, BCG vaccination was associated with enhanced memory T cell subsets as well as memory enhancing �c cytokines in elderly individuals, suggesting its ability to induce non-specific adaptive immune responses.",

Moreover, infection-control measures are inadequately implemented to avoid particulate generation. A laminar airflow ventilation system (LFVS) was developed to remove respiratory droplets released during treadmill exercise. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the number of aerosols during training on a treadmill and exercise intensity and to elucidate the effect of the LFVS on aerosol removal during anaerobic exercise. In this single-center observational study, the exercise tests were performed on a treadmill at Running Science Lab in Japan on 20 healthy subjects (age: 29�12 years, men: 80%). The subjects had a broad spectrum of aerobic capacities and fitness levels, including athletes, and had no comorbidities. All of them received no medication. The exercise intensity was increased by 1-km/h increments until the heart rate reached 85% of the expected maximum rate and then maintained for 10 min. The first 10 subjects were analyzed to examine whether exercise increased the concentration of airborne particulates in the exhaled air. For the remaining 10 subjects, the LFVS was activated during constant-load exercise to compare the number of respiratory droplets before and after LFVS use. During exercise, a steady amount of particulates before the lactate threshold (LT) was followed by a significant and gradual increase in respiratory droplets after the LT, particularly during anaerobic exercise. Furthermore, respiratory droplets ?0.3 �m significantly decreased after using LFVS (2120800�759700 vs. 560 � 170, p<0.001). The amount of respiratory droplets significantly increased after LT. The LFVS enabled a significant decrease in respiratory droplets during anaerobic exercise in healthy subjects. This study's findings will aid in exercising safely during this pandemic.",

We developed a RT-qPCR assay using the Luna Probe Universal One-Step RT-qPCR master mix with publicly available primers and probes to detect SARS-CoV-2 N gene, E gene, and human RNase P (LuNER) to address these shortcomings and meet the testing demands of a university campus and the local community.

Our program typically supports undergraduate development through research and/or clinical experience, meeting with individuals pursuing postgraduate training, and providing career development advice. Evidence supports the idea that summer programs transform undergraduates by clarifying their interest in research and encouraging those who haven't previously considered graduate studies. We were interested in exploring whether a virtual, synchronous program would increase participants' scientific identity and clarify postgraduate career planning. Rather than create a virtual research exposure, our 5-week \"Virtual VSSA\" program aimed to simulate the casual connections that would naturally be made with post-undergraduate trainees during a traditional summer program. In seminars, presenters discussed 1) their academic journey, explaining their motivations, goals, and reasons for pursuing a career in science as well as 2) a professional story that illustrated their training. Seminars included Vanderbilt University and Medical School faculty, M.D., MD/Ph.D., as well as Ph.D. students from diverse scientific and personal backgrounds. In addition, weekly informational sessions provided an overview of the nature of each degree program along with admissions advice. Through pre-and post-program surveys, we found that students who registered for this experience already strongly identified with the STEMM community (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics, and Medicine). However, participation in the Virtual VSSA increased their sense of belonging. We also uncovered a gap in participants' understanding of postgraduate pathways prior to participation and found that our program significantly increased their self-reported understanding of postgraduate programs. It also increased their understanding of why someone would pursue a Ph.D. or Ph.D./MD versus M.D. These changes did not uniformly impact participants' planned career paths. Overall, by providing personal, tangible stories of M.D., MD/Ph.D., and Ph.D. training, the Virtual VSSA program offered seminars that positively impacted students' sense of belonging with and connection to the STEMM disciplines.",

Prior studies have found a wide range of household secondary attack rates and may contain biases due to simplifying assumptions about transmission variability and test accuracy.METHODS: We compiled serological SARS-CoV-2 antibody test data and prior SARS-CoV-2 test reporting from members of 9,224 Utah households. We paired these data with a probabilistic model of household importation and transmission. We calculated a maximum likelihood estimate of the importation probability, mean and variability of household transmission probability, and sensitivity and specificity of test data. Given our household transmission estimates, we estimated the threshold of non-household transmission required for epidemic growth in the population.RESULTS: We estimated that individuals in our study households had a 0.41% (95% CI 0.32%- 0.51%) chance of acquiring SARS-CoV-2 infection outside their household. Our household secondary attack rate estimate was 36% (27%- 48%), substantially higher than the crude estimate of 16% unadjusted for imperfect serological test specificity and other factors. We found evidence for high variability in individual transmissibility, with higher probability of no transmissions or many transmissions compared to standard models. With household transmission at our estimates, the average number of non-household transmissions per case must be kept below 0.41 (0.33-0.52) to avoid continued growth of the pandemic in Utah.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that crude estimates of household secondary attack rate based on serology data without accounting for false positive tests may underestimate the true average transmissibility, even when test specificity is high. Our finding of potential high variability (overdispersion) in transmissibility of infected individuals is consistent with characterizing SARS-CoV-2 transmission being largely driven by superspreading from a minority of infected individuals. Mitigation efforts targeting large households and other locations where many people congregate indoors might curb continued spread of the virus.",

Mental health outcomes of HCWs who worked during the COVID-19 pandemic and the SARS outbreak were assessed using Impact of Events-Revised scale (IES-R), Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7), and Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9).RESULTS: Among 3852 participants, moderate/severe scores for symptoms of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (50.2%), anxiety (24.6%), and depression (31.5%) were observed among HCWs. Work during the 2003 SARS outbreak was reported by 1116 respondents (29.1%), who had lower scores for symptoms of PTSD (P = .002), anxiety (P < .001), and depression (P < .001) compared to those who had not worked during the SARS outbreak. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed non-clinical HCWs during this pandemic were at higher risk of anxiety (OR, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.19-2.15, P = .01) and depressive symptoms (OR, 2.03; 95% CI, 1.34-3.07, P < .001). HCWs using sedatives (OR, 2.55; 95% CI, 1.61-4.03, P < .001), those who cared for only 2-5 patients with COVID-19 (OR, 1.59; 95% CI, 1.06-2.38, P = .01), and those who had been in isolation for COVID-19 (OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 0.96-1.93, P = .05), were at higher risk of moderate/severe symptoms of PTSD. In addition, deterioration in sleep was associated with symptoms of PTSD (OR, 4.68, 95% CI, 3.74-6.30, P < .001), anxiety (OR, 3.09, 95% CI, 2.11-4.53, P < .001), and depression (OR 5.07, 95% CI, 3.48-7.39, P < .001).CONCLUSION: Psychological distress was observed in both clinical and non-clinical HCWs, with no impact from previous SARS work experience.

Antigen-based assays are inexpensive and can be rapidly mass-produced and deployed at point-of-care, with lateral flow assays (LFAs) being the most common format. While various manufacturers have produced commercially available SARS-Cov2 antigen LFAs, access to validated tests remains difficult or cost prohibitive in low-and middle-income countries.

Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive EVT alone or intravenous alteplase followed by EVT (the standard of care). The primary end point was functional outcome on the modified Rankin scale (range, 0 [no disability] to 6 [death]) at 90 days. We assessed the superiority of EVT alone over alteplase plus EVT, as well as noninferiority by a margin of 0.8 for the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the odds ratio of the two trial groups. Death from any cause and symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage were the main safety end points.RESULTS: The analysis included 539 patients. The median score on the modified Rankin scale at 90 days was 3 (interquartile range, 2 to 5) with EVT alone and 2 (interquartile range, 2 to 5) with alteplase plus EVT. The adjusted common odds ratio was 0.84 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.62 to 1.15; P = 0.28), which showed neither superiority nor noninferiority of EVT alone. Mortality was 20.5% with EVT alone and 15.8% with alteplase plus EVT (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 0.84 to 2.30). Symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage occurred in 5.9% and 5.3% of the patients in the respective groups (adjusted odds ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.60 to 2.81).CONCLUSIONS: In a randomized trial involving European patients, EVT alone was neither superior nor noninferior to intravenous alteplase followed by EVT with regard to disability outcome at 90 days after stroke. The incidence of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage was similar in the two groups.

The primary outcome was death from cardiovascular causes or incident heart failure (outpatient symptomatic heart failure or heart failure leading to hospitalization), whichever occurred first.RESULTS: A total of 5661 patients underwent randomization; 2830 were assigned to receive sacubitril-valsartan and 2831 to receive ramipril. Over a median of 22 months, a primary-outcome event occurred in 338 patients (11.9%) in the sacubitril-valsartan group and in 373 patients (13.2%) in the ramipril group (hazard ratio, 0.90; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.78 to 1.04; P = 0.17).

Other parts of this project focus on patients with cancer and infection.METHODS: We conducted a pilot study involving 4660 participants from 2183 families, among whom 161 disorders covering a broad spectrum of rare diseases were present. We collected data on clinical features with the use of Human Phenotype Ontology terms, undertook genome sequencing, applied automated variant prioritization on the basis of applied virtual gene panels and phenotypes, and identified novel pathogenic variants through research analysis.RESULTS: Diagnostic yields varied among family structures and were highest in family trios (both parents and a proband) and families with larger pedigrees. Diagnostic yields were much higher for disorders likely to have a monogenic cause (35%) than for disorders likely to have a complex cause (11%). Diagnostic yields for intellectual disability, hearing disorders, and vision disorders ranged from 40 to 55%. We made genetic diagnoses in 25% of the probands. A total of 14% of the diagnoses were made by means of the combination of research and automated approaches, which was critical for cases in which we found etiologic noncoding, structural, and mitochondrial genome variants and coding variants poorly covered by exome sequencing. Cohortwide burden testing across 57,000 genomes enabled the discovery of three new disease genes and 19 new associations. Of the genetic diagnoses that we made, 25% had immediate ramifications for clinical decision making for the patients or their relatives.CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study of genome sequencing in a national health care system showed an increase in diagnostic yield across a range of rare diseases.

Here, we assessed the antiviral capacity of a minimal RIG-I agonist, stem-loop RNA 14 (SLR14), in viral control, disease prevention, post-infection therapy, and cross-variant protection in mouse models of SARS-CoV-2 infection. A single dose of SLR14 prevented viral infection in the lower respiratory tract and development of severe disease in a type I interferon (IFN-I)-dependent manner. SLR14 demonstrated remarkable prophylactic protective capacity against lethal SARS-CoV-2 infection and retained considerable efficacy as a therapeutic agent. In immunodeficient mice carrying chronic SARS-CoV-2 infection, SLR14 elicited near-sterilizing innate immunity in the absence of the adaptive immune system. In the context of infection with variants of concern (VOCs), SLR14 conferred broad protection against emerging VOCs. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of SLR14 as a host-directed, broad-spectrum antiviral for early post-exposure treatment and treatment of chronically infected immunosuppressed patients.",

The second article by Viotti et�al. provides an excellent overview of outcome data from >1,000 mosaic embryo transfers. The investigators make a strong case for three categorizations of embryos: euploid, aneuploid, and mosaic, and that use of mosaic embryos will prevent the discard of embryos that may lead to live birth. The final piece in this series was written by Besser et�al., who discussed the various society recommendations for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnostic testing after mosaic embryo transfer and question whether these are truly data-driven. This collection of pieces will give the reader a deeper understanding of the controversy and management of mosaic embryo transfer.",

The American Fertility Society (AFS) Classification from 1988 has been the most recognized and utilized. The advantages of this iconic classification include its simplicity, recognizability, and correlation with clinical pregnancy outcomes. However, the AFS classification has been criticized for its focus primarily on uterine anomalies, with exclusion of those of the vagina and cervix, its lack of clear diagnostic criteria, and its inability to classify complex aberrations. Despite this classification and others, the wide range of m?llerian anomalies is still largely unknown and confusing to many providers. Consequently, m?llerian anomalies may go undiagnosed for extended periods, receive inappropriate or inadequate surgical interventions, and result in persistent issues such as pain or loss of reproductive function. The American Society for Reproductive Medicine Task Force on M?llerian Anomalies Classification was formed and charged with designing a new classification. The Task Force set goals for a new classification and chose to base it on the iconic AFS classification from 1988 because of its simplicity and recognizability, while expanding and updating it to include all categories of anomalies. In addition, this was recognized as an opportunity to raise awareness of this area of medicine, educate providers and learners, and promote patient advocacy. Presented here is the new American Society for Reproductive Medicine M?llerian Anomalies Classification�2021.",

Controls were derived from the National Database for Autism Research.PATIENT(S): Cases comprised 19 chromosomally normal loss conceptus-parent trios. Controls comprised 547 unaffected siblings of autism case-parent trios.INTERVENTION(S): None.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): The rate of damaging variants in the exome (loss of function and missense-damaging) and the proportions of probands with at least one such variant among cases vs. controls.RESULTS: The proportions of probands with at least one rare damaging variant were 36.8% among cases and 22.9% among controls (odds ratio, 2.0; 99% confidence interval, 0.5-7.3). No case had a variant in a known fetal anomaly gene. The proportion with variants in possibly embryonic lethal genes increased in case probands (odds ratio, 14.5; 99% confidence interval, 1.5-89.7); variants occurred in BAZ1A, FBN2, and TIMP2.CONCLUSION(S): Rare genetic variants in the conceptus may be a cause of chromosomally normal pregnancy loss. A larger sample is needed to estimate the magnitude of the association with precision and identify relevant biologic pathways.",

However, current methods for mapping antibody binding to epitopes require a targeted experimental approach, which limits throughput. To address these limitations, we developed Multiplexed Epitope Substitution Analysis (MESA) which can rapidly characterize various distinct epitopes using millions of antibody-binding peptides. We screened peptides from a random 12-mer library that bound to human serum antibody repertoires and determined their sequences using next-generation sequencing (NGS). Computationally, we divided target epitope sequences into overlapping k-mer subsequences and substituted the positions in each k-mer with all 20 amino acids, mimicking a saturation mutagenesis. We then determined enrichments of the substituted k-mers in the screened peptide dataset and used these enrichments to identify substitutions favored for binding at each position in the target epitope, ultimately revealing the precise binding motif. To validate MESA, we determined binding motifs for monoclonal antibodies spiked into serum, recovering the expected binding positions and amino acid preferences. To characterize epitopes bound by a population, we analyzed 50 serum specimens to determine the binding motifs within various target epitopes from common pathogens. Additionally, by analyzing various HSV-1 glycoprotein epitopes, MESA revealed unique binding signatures for HSV-1 seropositive specimens and demonstrated the variability of binding signatures within a population. These results demonstrate that MESA can rapidly identify and characterize binding motifs for an unlimited number of epitopes from a single experiment, accelerating discoveries and enhancing our understanding of antibody-epitope interactions.",

The benefit of somatic genomic sequencing in pancreatic cancer remains unclear. This study aims to assess the evidence supporting genomic sequencing to inform treatment selection for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.METHODS: A systematic review identified prospective studies of exocrine pancreatic cancer patients published before August 2020 which conducted genomic sequencing to inform treatment selection. Outcomes of interest included the proportion of patients with targetable alterations, the proportion that received targeted treatments, and the impact of targeted treatments on overall survival. Meta-analysis for proportions and hazard ratios was performed using Dersimonian and Laird random effect models.RESULTS: 19 studies (representing 2048 pancreatic cancer patients) were included. Sequencing methodologies, definitions of targetable alterations, and approaches treatment selection varied across studies and were incompletely reported. 590 of 1382 sequenced patients harboured a targetable alteration (random effects meta-analysis estimate of the proportion 0.46, 95% confidence interval 0.32-0.61). The proportion of patients with targetable alterations was highly heterogenous between studies (I2 93%, P�<�0.001). 91 of 1390 patients received a matched therapy based on their targetable alterations (random effects meta-analysis estimate of the proportion 0.12, 95% CI 0.06-0.23). One observational study reported an overall survival benefit of matched therapy.CONCLUSIONS: Genomic sequencing frequently identifies targetable alterations in pancreatic cancers. Further research is required to standardize the definitions of targetable alterations, the approach to treatment matching, and quantify the benefit of targeted therapy.",

The aim of the present study was to assess whether BW has a long-term effect on foveal retinal thickness (RT) and is still present in adulthood.Methods: In the German population-based Gutenberg Health Study (GHS), participants were examined with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. The association between self-reported BW and RT in the foveolar and perifoveal locations was assessed. Multivariable linear regression analyses with adjustment for potential confounders and grading of foveal hypoplasia were performed.Results: Overall, RT measurements and self-reported BW were available for 2,539 participants (1300 female, mean age 54.5 � 9.7 years). The absolute foveolar RT was 239.6 � 25.8 �m, 232.2 � 20.1 �m and 234.8 � 21.0 �m, respectively, in the low (<2500 g), normal (2500-4000 g) and high (>4000 g) BW groups (P < 0.001). After adjustment for confounders, an association was observed between lower BW and increased foveolar thickness (B = -0.35 [95% confidence interval {CI}: -0.49; -0.20] �m/100 g; P < 0.001), whereas only a weak association with RT was observed with the nasal (P = 0.010), temporal (P = 0.011), and inferior (P = 0.021) quadrants in the 1 mm distance, with no association in the 2 mm distance to the fovea. Foveal hypoplasia grade 1 was more frequent in the low BW group (6.8%) compared to the normal (0.9%) and high BW group (1.2%).Conclusions: This study provides evidence of an association between lower BW and increased foveolar thickness and foveal hypoplasia, indicating that prenatal growth may affect macular morphology, which in turn may persist until adulthood and predispose to retinal disease later in life.",

Controversy exists regarding whether to continue treatment for SDB with positive airway pressure given concern for aerosolization with limited data to inform professional society recommendations.Objective: To investigate the association of SDB (identified via polysomnogram) and sleep-related hypoxia with (1) SARS-CoV-2 positivity and (2) World Health Organization (WHO)-designated COVID-19 clinical outcomes while accounting for confounding including obesity, underlying cardiopulmonary disease, cancer, and smoking history.Design, Setting, and Participants: This case-control study was conducted within the Cleveland Clinic Health System (Ohio and Florida) and included all patients who were tested for COVID-19 between March 8 and November 30, 2020, and who had an available sleep study record. Sleep indices and SARS-CoV-2 positivity were assessed with overlap propensity score weighting, and COVID-19 clinical outcomes were assessed using the institutional registry.Exposures: Sleep study-identified SDB (defined by frequency of apneas and hypopneas using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index [AHI]) and sleep-related hypoxemia (percentage of total sleep time at <90% oxygen saturation [TST <90]).Main Outcomes and Measures: Outcomes were SARS-CoV-2 infection and WHO-designated COVID-19 clinical outcomes (hospitalization, use of supplemental oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and death).Results: Of 350 710 individuals tested for SARS-CoV-2, 5402 (mean [SD] age, 56.4 [14.5] years; 3005 women [55.6%]) had a prior sleep study, of whom 1935 (35.8%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Of the 5402 participants, 1696 were Black (31.4%), 3259 were White (60.3%), and 822 were of other race or ethnicity (15.2%). Patients who were positive vs negative for SARS-CoV-2 had a higher AHI score (median, 16.2 events/h [IQR, 6.1-39.5 events/h] vs 13.6 events/h [IQR, 5.5-33.6 events/h]; P < .001) and increased TST <90 (median, 1.8% sleep time [IQR, 0.10%-12.8% sleep time] vs 1.4% sleep time [IQR, 0.10%-10.8% sleep time]; P = .02). After overlap propensity score-weighted logistic regression, no SDB measures were associated with SARS-CoV-2 positivity. Median TST <90 was associated with the WHO-designated COVID-19 ordinal clinical outcome scale (adjusted odds ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.10-1.74; P = .005). Time-to-event analyses showed sleep-related hypoxia associated with a 31% higher rate of hospitalization and mortality (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.08-1.57; P = .005).Conclusions and Relevance: In this case-control study, SDB and sleep-related hypoxia were not associated with increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity; however, once patients were infected with SARS-CoV-2, sleep-related hypoxia was an associated risk factor for detrimental COVID-19 outcomes.",

The ACS subgroups were ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI; n = 10), non-STEMI (n = 10), and unstable angina (n = 11). OA three-dimensional (3D) models were reconstructed based on computed tomographic angiography, and morphological aspects of the OA were measured quantitatively. Moreover, numerical simulation by computational fluid dynamics was used to obtain hemodynamic information of the OA.Results: The study reconstructed 41 OA models. Hemodynamic simulation revealed a significant decrease in OA blood velocity in patients with ACS compared with the HCs (median velocity, 0.046 vs. 0.147 m/s; P < 0.001). No differences in the morphological data for the OA were observed. Also, no differences in the mass flow ratio of OA to the ipsilateral internal carotid artery was found. Similar differences were observed between the ACS subgroups and HCs. OA blood velocity was negatively correlated with body mass index, abdominal circumference, left ventricular ejection fraction, and triacylglycerol and was positively correlated with early to late transmitral flow velocity, N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, serum creatinine, and potassium.Conclusions: The initial OA blood velocity was slower in patients with ACS and was associated with ACS-related clinical parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first study to analyze OA characteristics in ACS using 3D model reconstruction and hemodynamic simulation, providing new perspectives on the relationship between ischemic heart disease and ocular manifestations.",

Thus, alternative agents are needed. Based on the known biology of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in the retinoblastoma pathway, we systematically studied whether the HDAC inhibitor belinostat is a viable, molecularly targeted alternative agent for intravitreal delivery that might provide comparable efficacy, without toxicity.Methods: In vivo pharmacokinetic experiments in rabbits and in vitro cytotoxicity experiments were performed to determine the 90% inhibitory concentration (IC90). Functional toxicity by electroretinography and structural toxicity by optical coherence tomography (OCT), OCT angiography, and histopathology were evaluated in rabbits following three injections of belinostat 350 �g (2? IC90) or 700 �g (4? IC90), compared with melphalan 12.5 �g (rabbit equivalent of the human dose). The relative efficacy of intravitreal belinostat versus melphalan to treat WERI-Rb1 human cell xenografts in rabbit eyes was directly quantified. RNA sequencing was used to assess belinostat-induced changes in RB cell gene expression.Results: The maximum nontoxic dose of belinostat was 350 �g, which caused no reductions in electroretinography parameters, retinal microvascular loss on OCT angiography, or retinal degeneration. Melphalan caused severe retinal structural and functional toxicity. Belinostat 350 �g (equivalent to 700 �g in the larger human eye) was equally effective at eradicating vitreous seeds in the rabbit xenograft model compared with melphalan (95.5% reduction for belinostat, P < 0.001; 89.4% reduction for melphalan, P < 0.001; belinostat vs. melphalan, P = 0.10). Even 700 �g belinostat (equivalent to 1400 �g in humans) caused only minimal toxicity. Widespread changes in gene expression resulted.Conclusions: Molecularly targeted inhibition of HDACs with intravitreal belinostat was equally effective as standard-of-care melphalan but without retinal toxicity. Belinostat may therefore be an attractive agent to pursue clinically for intravitreal treatment of retinoblastoma.",

As telerehabilitation allows for the provision of care in situations of social distancing, it may mitigate the negative effects of confinement. The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy, adherence and usability of a teleneurorehabilitation intervention for patients with acquired brain injury.PATIENTS AND METHODS: All patients included in a face-to-face neurorehabilitation programme at the time of the declaration of the state of alarm in Spain due to COVID-19 and who agreed to participate in the study were included in a teleneurorehabilitation programme. The effectiveness of the programme, understood as an improvement in independence, was quantified with the Barthel index. Adherence to the programme and usability of the tool were explored through questionnaires.RESULTS: Altogether, 46 patients, accounting for 70.6% of the total, participated in the study. Participants significantly improved their independence and showed an improvement in the Barthel index between the start (77.3 � 28.6) and the end of the programme (82.3 � 26). Adherence to the intervention was very high (8.1 � 2.2 out of 10) and the online sessions were the most highly rated content. The tool used showed a high usability (50.1 � 9.9 out of 60) and could be used without assistance by more than half the participants.CONCLUSION: The teleneurorehabilitation intervention was found to be effective in improving patients' independence, and promoted a high degree of adherence and usability.",

We aimed to estimate the annual health and financial burden of ACEs for 28 European countries.METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Applied Social Sciences Index and Abstracts, Criminal Justice Databases, and Education Resources Information Center for quantitative studies (published Jan 1, 1990, to Sept 8, 2020) that reported prevalence of ACEs and risks of health outcomes associated with ACEs. Pooled relative risks were calculated for associations between ACEs and harmful alcohol use, smoking, illicit drug use, high body-mass index, depression, anxiety, interpersonal violence, cancer, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and respiratory disease. Country-level ACE prevalence was calculated using available data. Country-level population attributable fractions (PAFs) due to ACEs were generated and applied to 2019 estimates of disability-adjusted life-years. Financial costs (US$ in 2019) were estimated using an adapted human capital approach.FINDINGS: In most countries, interpersonal violence had the largest PAFs due to ACEs (range 14�7-53�5%), followed by harmful alcohol use (15�7-45�0%), illicit drug use (15�2-44�9%), and anxiety (13�9%-44�8%). Harmful alcohol use, smoking, and cancer had the highest ACE-attributable costs in many countries. Total ACE-attributable costs ranged from $0�1 billion (Montenegro) to $129�4 billion (Germany) and were equivalent to between 1�1% (Sweden and Turkey) and 6�0% (Ukraine) of nations' gross domestic products.INTERPRETATION: Availability of ACE data varies widely between countries and country-level estimates cannot be directly compared. However, findings suggest ACEs are associated with major health and financial costs across European countries. The cost of not investing to prevent ACEs must be recognised, particularly as countries look to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, which interrupted services and education, and potentially increased risk factors for ACEs.FUNDING: WHO Regional Office for Europe.",

We aimed to analyse data on the number of deaths, years of life lost, and mortality rates by sex and age group in people aged 10-24 years in 204 countries and territories from 1950 to 2019 by use of estimates from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) 2019.METHODS: We report trends in estimated total numbers of deaths and mortality rate per 100 000 population in young people aged 10-24 years by age group (10-14 years, 15-19 years, and 20-24 years) and sex in 204 countries and territories between 1950 and 2019 for all causes, and between 1980 and 2019 by cause of death. We analyse variation in outcomes by region, age group, and sex, and compare annual rate of change in mortality in young people aged 10-24 years with that in children aged 0-9 years from 1990 to 2019. We then analyse the association between mortality in people aged 10-24 years and socioeconomic development using the GBD Socio-demographic Index (SDI), a composite measure based on average national educational attainment in people older than 15 years, total fertility rate in people younger than 25 years, and income per capita. We assess the association between SDI and all-cause mortality in 2019, and analyse the ratio of observed to expected mortality by SDI using the most recent available data release (2017).FINDINGS: In 2019 there were 1�49 million deaths (95% uncertainty interval 1�39-1�59) worldwide in people aged 10-24 years, of which 61% occurred in males. 32�7% of all adolescent deaths were due to transport injuries, unintentional injuries, or interpersonal violence and conflict; 32�1% were due to communicable, nutritional, or maternal causes; 27�0% were due to non-communicable diseases; and 8�2% were due to self-harm. Since 1950, deaths in this age group decreased by 30�0% in females and 15�3% in males, and sex-based differences in mortality rate have widened in most regions of the world. Geographical variation has also increased, particularly in people aged 10-14 years. Since 1980, communicable and maternal causes of death have decreased sharply as a proportion of total deaths in most GBD super-regions, but remain some of the most common causes in sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia, where more than half of all adolescent deaths occur. Annual percentage decrease in all-cause mortality rate since 1990 in adolescents aged 15-19 years was 1�3% in males and 1�6% in females, almost half that of males aged 1-4 years (2�4%), and around a third less than in females aged 1-4 years (2�5%). The proportion of global deaths in people aged 0-24 years that occurred in people aged 10-24 years more than doubled between 1950 and 2019, from 9�5% to 21�6%.INTERPRETATION: Variation in adolescent mortality between countries and by sex is widening, driven by poor progress in reducing deaths in males and older adolescents. Improving global adolescent mortality will require action to address the specific vulnerabilities of this age group, which are being overlooked. Furthermore, indirect effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are likely to jeopardise efforts to improve health outcomes including mortality in young people aged 10-24 years. There is an urgent need to respond to the changing global burden of adolescent mortality, address inequities where they occur, and improve the availability and quality of primary mortality data in this age group.FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.",

The objective of this retrospective cross-sectional study was to generate real-world multiple sclerosis-specific vaccine safety information, particularly in the context of specific DMTs, and provide information to mitigate specific concerns in vaccine hesitant PwMS.METHODS: Between 3/2021 and 6/2021, participants in iConquerMS, an online people-powered research network, reported SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, experiences of local (itch, pain, redness, swelling, or warmth at injection site) and systemic (fever, chills, fatigue, headache, joint pain, malaise, muscle ache, nausea, allergic, and other) reactions within 24 hours (none, mild, moderate, and severe), DMT use, and other attributes. Multivariable models characterized associations between clinical factors and reactogenicity.RESULTS: In 719 PwMS, 64% reported experiencing a reaction after their first vaccination shot, and 17% reported a severe reaction. The most common reactions were pain at injection site (54%), fatigue (34%), headache (28%), and malaise (21%). Younger age, being female, prior SARS-CoV-2 infection, and receiving the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Oxford-AstraZeneca) vs BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) vaccine were associated with experiencing a reaction after the first vaccine dose. Similar relationships were observed for a severe reaction, including higher odds of reactions among PwMS with more physical impairment and lower odds of reactions for PwMS on an alpha4-integrin blocker or sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator. In 442 PwMS who received their second vaccination shot, 74% reported experiencing a reaction, whereas 22% reported a severe reaction. Reaction profiles after the second shot were similar to those reported after the first shot. Younger PwMS and those who received the mRNA-1273 (Moderna) vs BNT162b2 vaccine reported higher reactogenicity after the second shot, whereas those on a sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor modulator or fumarate were significantly less likely to report a reaction.DISCUSSION: SARS-CoV-2 vaccine reactogenicity profiles and the associated factors in this convenience sample of PwMS appear similar to those reported in the general population. PwMS on specific DMTs were less likely to report vaccine reactions. Overall, the short-term vaccine reactions experienced in the study population were mostly self-limiting, including pain at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and fever.",

The aim of this study is to compare COVID-19-related outcomes collected in an Italian cohort of patients with MS with the outcomes expected in the age- and sex-matched Italian population.METHODS: Hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death after COVID-19 diagnosis of 1,362 patients with MS were compared with the age- and sex-matched Italian population in a retrospective observational case-cohort study with population-based control. The observed vs the expected events were compared in the whole MS cohort and in different subgroups (higher risk: Expanded Disability Status Scale [EDSS] score > 3 or at least 1 comorbidity, lower risk: EDSS score ? 3 and no comorbidities) by the �2 test, and the risk excess was quantified by risk ratios (RRs).RESULTS: The risk of severe events was about twice the risk in the age- and sex-matched Italian population: RR = 2.12 for hospitalization (p < 0.001), RR = 2.19 for ICU admission (p < 0.001), and RR = 2.43 for death (p < 0.001). The excess of risk was confined to the higher-risk group (n = 553). In lower-risk patients (n = 809), the rate of events was close to that of the Italian age- and sex-matched population (RR = 1.12 for hospitalization, RR = 1.52 for ICU admission, and RR = 1.19 for death). In the lower-risk group, an increased hospitalization risk was detected in patients on anti-CD20 (RR = 3.03, p = 0.005), whereas a decrease was detected in patients on interferon (0 observed vs 4 expected events, p = 0.04).DISCUSSION: Overall, the MS cohort had a risk of severe events that is twice the risk than the age- and sex-matched Italian population. This excess of risk is mainly explained by the EDSS score and comorbidities, whereas a residual increase of hospitalization risk was observed in patients on anti-CD20 therapies and a decrease in people on interferon.",

CRC management in Denmark was thought to have been relatively less impacted than in other nations during the first wave of the pandemic. The aim of this study was to determine the pandemic's impact on CRC in Denmark.METHODS: The Danish national cancer registry identified patients with newly diagnosed with CRC from 1 March 2020 to 1 August 2020 (pandemic interval) and corresponding dates in 2019 (prepandemic interval). Data regarding clinicopathological demographics and perioperative outcomes were retrieved and compared between the two cohorts.RESULTS: Total CRC diagnoses (201 versus 359 per month, P = 0.008) and screening diagnoses (38 versus 80 per month, P = 0.016) were both lower in the pandemic interval. The proportions of patients presenting acutely and the stage at presentation were, however, unaffected. For those patients having surgery, both colonic and rectal cancer operations fell to about half the prepandemic levels: colon (187 (i.q.r. 183-188) to 96 (i.q.r. 94-112) per month, P = 0.032) and rectal cancers (63 (i.q.r. 59-75) to 32 (i.q.r. 28-42) per month, P = 0.008). No difference was seen in surgical practice or postoperative 30-day mortality rate (colon 2.2 versus 2.2 per cent, P = 0.983; rectal 1.0 versus 2.9 per cent, P = 0.118) between the cohorts. Treatment during the pandemic interval was not independently associated with death at 30 or 90 days.CONCLUSION: The initial wave of the COVID-19 pandemic reduced the number of new diagnoses made and number of operations but had limited impact on technique or outcomes of CRC care in Denmark.",

We aimed to leverage genetic data to triangulate reported associations. Methods and Results Analyses primarily focused on critical COVID-19, defined as hospitalization with COVID-19 requiring respiratory support or resulting in death. Cross-trait linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to estimate genetic correlations of critical COVID-19 with ischemic stroke, other related cardiovascular outcomes, and risk factors common to both COVID-19 and cardiovascular disease (body mass index, smoking and chronic inflammation, estimated using C-reactive protein). Mendelian randomization analysis was performed to investigate whether liability to critical COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of any cardiovascular outcome for which genetic correlation was identified. There was evidence of genetic correlation between critical COVID-19 and ischemic stroke (rg=0.29, false discovery rate [FDR]=0.012), body mass index (rg=0.21, FDR=0.00002), and C-reactive protein (rg=0.20, FDR=0.00035), but no other trait investigated. In Mendelian randomization, liability to critical COVID-19 was associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke (odds ratio [OR] per logOR increase in genetically predicted critical COVID-19 liability 1.03, 95% CI 1.00-1.06, P-value=0.03). Similar estimates were obtained for ischemic stroke subtypes. Consistent estimates were also obtained when performing statistical sensitivity analyses more robust to the inclusion of pleiotropic variants, including multivariable Mendelian randomization analyses adjusting for potential genetic confounding through body mass index, smoking, and chronic inflammation. There was no evidence to suggest that genetic liability to ischemic stroke increased the risk of critical COVID-19. Conclusions These data support that liability to critical COVID-19 is associated with an increased risk of ischemic stroke.

The resulting reductions in anthropogenic activity represent an unprecedented event that yields a glimpse into a future where emissions to the atmosphere are reduced. Furthermore, the abrupt reduction in emissions during the lockdown periods led to clearly observable changes in atmospheric composition, which provide direct insight into feedbacks between the Earth system and human activity. While air pollutants and greenhouse gases share many common anthropogenic sources, there is a sharp difference in the response of their atmospheric concentrations to COVID-19 emissions changes, due in large part to their different lifetimes. Here, we discuss several key takeaways from modeling and observational studies. First, despite dramatic declines in mobility and associated vehicular emissions, the atmospheric growth rates of greenhouse gases were not slowed, in part due to decreased ocean uptake of CO2 and a likely increase in CH4 lifetime from reduced NO x emissions. Second, the response of O3 to decreased NO x emissions showed significant spatial and temporal variability, due to differing chemical regimes around the world. Finally, the overall response of atmospheric composition to emissions changes is heavily modulated by factors including carbon-cycle feedbacks to CH4 and CO2, background pollutant levels, the timing and location of emissions changes, and climate feedbacks on air quality, such as wildfires and the ozone climate penalty.",

It is, however, uncertain whether students are really at higher risk of mental health disturbances than non-students and if they are differentially impacted by lockdown periods over time. The objective of our study was to compare the frequency of depressive symptoms, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts in students and non-students enrolled in the same study in France and during the same key periods of the COVID-19 epidemic. Using a repeated cross-sectional design, we collected data from a sample of 3783 participants in the CONFINS study during three recruitment waves between March 2020 and January 2021. Multivariate logistic regression models, adjusted for potential confounding factors, showed that students were more likely to have high scores of depressive symptoms and anxiety more frequently than non-students. These differences were particularly strong during the first (depressive symptoms: adjusted odds ratio aOR 1.59, 95% CI 1.22-2.08; anxiety: aOR 1.63, 95% CI 1.22-2.18) and second lockdowns (depressive symptoms: aOR 1.80, 95% CI 1.04-3.12; anxiety: aOR 2.25, 95% CI 1.24-4.10). These findings suggest that the restrictive measures-lockdown and curfew-have an alarmingly stronger negative impact on students than on non-students and underline the frailty of students' mental health and the need to pay greater attention to this population in this epidemic-related context.",

The association of the gastrointestinal symptoms with the COVID-19-mediated inflammatory response triggered by the gastrointestinal immune system was investigated in this paper. Intestinal inflammation marker fecal calprotectin along with serum calprotectin and other inflammatory markers were measured in COVID-19 cases with and without GI manifestations as well as healthy individuals. Analyses were performed to compare COVID-19 patient subgroups and healthy controls and examine the relationship between fecal and serum calprotectin levels with gastrointestinal symptoms and disease severity. COVID-19 patients (n = 70) were found to have markedly elevated median levels of fecal (124.3 vs. 25.0��g/g; P < 0/0001) and serum calprotectin (3500 vs. 1060�ng/mL; P < 0/0001) compared with uninfected controls. Fecal and serum calprotectin levels were not significantly different between COVID-19 patients who displayed GI symptoms and those who did not. Compared with other acute phase markers, both fecal and serum calprotectin were superior in identifying COVID-19 patients who progressed to severe illness. Although the progression of COVID-19 disease is marked by an elevation of fecal and serum calprotectin, gastrointestinal symptoms or diarrhea were not correlated with calprotectin increase level.",

The current study uses affective priming, an indirect behavioural measure of implicit attitude, to evaluate COVID-19 attitudes. Explicitly, participants rated their overall risk perception associated with contracting COVID-19 significantly lower compared to their perception of necessary precautions and overall adherence to public health measures. During baseline trials, participants explicitly rated COVID-19 affiliated words as unpleasant, similar to traditional unpleasant word stimuli. Despite rating the COVID-19 affiliated words as unpleasant, affective priming was not observed for congruent prime-target COVID-19 affiliated word pairs when compared to congruent prime-target pleasant and unpleasant words. Overall, these results provide quantitative evidence that COVID-19 affiliated words do not invoke the same implicit attitude response as traditional pleasant and unpleasant word stimuli, despite conscious explicit rating of the COVID-19 words as unpleasant. This reduction in unpleasant attitude towards COVID-19 related words may contribute towards decreased fear-related behaviours and increased incidences of risky-behaviour facilitating the movement of the virus.",

We have performed systematic experiments to quantify and understand the differences between standardized test methods for N95 respirators (NIOSH�TEB-APR-STP-0059 under US�42�CFR�84), medical face masks (ASTM�F2299/F2100), and COVID-19-related barrier face coverings (ASTM�F3502-21). Our experiments demonstrate the role of face velocity, particle properties (mean size, size variability, electric charge, density, and shape), measurement techniques, and environmental preconditioning. The measured filtration efficiency was most sensitive to changes in face velocity and particle charge. Relative to the NIOSH method, users of the ASTM F2299/F2100 method have commonly used non-neutralized (highly charged) aerosols as well as smaller face velocities, each of which may result in approximately 10% higher measured filtration efficiencies. In the NIOSH method, environmental conditioning at elevated humidity increased filtration efficiency in some commercial samples while decreasing it in others, indicating that measurement should be performed both with and without conditioning. More generally, our results provide an experimental basis for the comparison of respirators certified under various international methods, including FFP2, KN95, P2, Korea 1st Class, and DS2.",

Understanding that Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) disproportionately affects men than women results in great challenges.

We applied a holistic bioinformatics method to investigate molecular variations of known SARS-CoV-2 interacting human proteins mainly expressed in gonadal tissues (testis and ovary), allowing for the identification of potential genetic targets for this infection. Functional enrichment and interaction network analyses were also performed to better investigate the biological differences between testicular and ovarian responses in the SARS-CoV-2 infection, paying particular attention to genes linked to immune-related pathways, reactions of host cells after intracellular infection, steroid hormone biosynthesis, receptor signaling, and the complement cascade, in order to evaluate their potential association with sexual difference in the likelihood of infection and severity of symptoms. The analysis revealed that within the testis network TMPRSS2, ADAM10, SERPING1, and CCR5 were present, while within the ovary network we found BST2, GATA1, ENPEP, TLR4, TLR7, IRF1, and IRF2.

We assume a Watts-Strogatz small-world network which allows to distinguish contacts within clustered cliques and unclustered, random contacts in the population, which have been shown to be crucial in sustaining the epidemic. In contrast to other works, which use coarse-grained network structures from anonymized data, like cell phone data, we consider the contacts of individual agents explicitly. We show that NPIs drastically reduced random contacts in the transmission network, increased network clustering, and resulted in a previously unappreciated transition from an exponential to a constant regime of new cases. In this regime, the disease spreads like a wave with a finite wave speed that depends on the number of contacts in a nonlinear fashion, which we can predict by mean field theory.",

We assessed the predictive accuracy of sCys C for COVID-19 severity by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The participants were divided into two groups based on the sCys C cut-off value. We evaluated the association between high sCys C level and the development of severe COVID-19 disease, using a COX proportional hazards regression model.

Studies have shown that glucosamine (GlcN) can be used to abate the progression and improve this disease. Based on this point of view, we try to verify the connection between GlcN and osteoarthritis and find more effective biomarkers.Methods: We downloaded the GSE72575 data set from the GEO database, and used the R language to perform DEG analysis on the gene expression profile of the samples. Next, the GO function and the KEGG signaling pathways were analyzed through the DAVID database, and then, the KEGG pathways enriched in the gene set were analyzed based on GSEA. Then, the PPI network of DEGs was constructed based on the STRING online database, and finally, the hub genes were selected by Cytoscape.Results: Three GlcN-treated MH7A cell treatment groups and 3 control groups in the GSE72575 data set were studied. Through analysis, there were 52 DEGs in these samples. Then, through GO, KEGG, and GSEA, regulation of endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced intrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway, FoxO signaling pathway, JAK-STAT signaling pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, TGF-beta signaling pathway, and ECM receptor interaction were involved in the regulatory mechanisms of the osteoarthritis pathogenesis. After that, the hub genes IL6 and DDIT3 were identified through PPI network construction and analysis. And it was found that IL6 was lowly expressed in the group with GlcN-treated MH7A cells, while DDIT3 was highly expressed.Conclusion: The above results provide a basis for GlcN to participate in the treatment of osteoarthritis and a possibility for finding effective therapeutic targets.",

Dimethyl fumarate (DMF) has been found to effectively depress oxidative stress and inflammation via the Nrf2 pathway. Hence, this project was designed to explore the underlying mechanisms of how DMF protects NPCs from damage by LPS challenge.Methods and Results: CCK8 assay and flow cytometry of apoptosis indicated that DMF treatment attenuated LPS-induced NPC damage. Western blot analysis demonstrated that DMF enhanced the expressions of nuclear factor-erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in LPS-challenged NPCs. DMF treatment significantly decreased the accumulation of ROS, downregulated inflammatory cytokines (p-NF-�B, IL-1�, and TNF-�), and ER stress-associated apoptosis proteins (Bip, calpain-1, caspase-12, caspase-3, and Bax) in LPS-challenged NPCs. The level of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 was promoted by DMF treatment in LPS-challenged NPCs. Glutathione (GSH) assay showed that DMF treatment improved reduced to oxidized glutathione ratio in LPS-challenged NPCs. Furthermore, the results of western blot analysis indicated that in LPS-challenged NPCs, DMF treatment ameliorated the elevated levels of matrix degradation enzymes (MMP-13, aggrecanase 1) and type I collagen and the reduced levels of matrix composition (type II collagen and ACAN). However, Nrf2 knockdown abolished these protective effects of DMF.Conclusion: Our data suggested that treatment with DMF mitigated LPS-induced oxidative stress, inflammation, and ER stress-associated apoptosis in NPCs via the Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, thus reliving LPS-induced dysfunction of NPCs, which offered a novel potential pharmacological treatment strategy for IVDD.",

There is paucity of data on hyperglycemic emergencies in Cameroon. The objective of this study was to investigate the precipitants and outcomes of patients admitted for hyperglycemic emergencies in the Buea Regional Hospital in the South West Region of Cameroon.Methods: in this retrospective study the medical records of patients admitted for hyperglycemic emergencies between 2013 and 2016 in the medical unit of the Buea Regional Hospital were reviewed. We extracted data on demographic characteristics, admission clinical characteristics, precipitants, and treatment outcomes. Logistic regression was used to determine predictors of mortality.Results: data were available for 60 patients (51.7% females) admitted for hyperglycemic emergencies. The mean age was 55.2�16.3 (range 18-86). Overall there were 51 (85%) cases of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Twenty six (43.3%) of the patients had hypertension. The most common precipitants of hyperglycemic emergencies were infections (41.7%), newly diagnosed diabetes (33.3%) and non-adherence to medications (33.3%). Mean admission blood glucose was 574mg/dl�70.0mg/dl. The median length of hospital stay was 6 days. Overall case fatality rate was 21.7%. Six (46.2%) deaths were related to infections. Predictors of mortality were a Glasgow coma score <13(p<0.001), a diastolic blood pressure <60 mmHg (p=0.034) and a heart rate >90(0.057) on admission.Conclusion: admission for hyperglycemic emergencies in this semi-urban hospital is associated with abnormally high case fatality. Infections, newly diagnosed diabetes and non-adherence to medications are the commonest precipitants of hyperglycemic emergencies. Public health measures to reduce morbidity and mortality from hyperglycemic crisis are urgently needed.",

This entity represents the eighth case of palatine tonsil fibroepithelial polyp in the English literature. She presented with a polypoid mass at the right tonsil and unspecified throat symptoms. Physicians should pay attention to such lesions because of the residual risk of malignant transformation, along with non-specific symptoms. Differential diagnosis was among neurofibroma, lipoma, squamous papilloma and fibroepithelial polyp. Histopathological examination following tonsillectomy showed a structure rich in vesicles inside lamina propria and surrounding inflammation, establishing the diagnosis of a fibroepithelial polyp.

A total of 24 semi-structured individual interviews and 6 focus groups were used to collect data. Thematic analysis was used.Results: malnutrition refers to a lack of food and undernourishment. It revolves around the amount of rice consumption, socio-cultural factors and insufficient financial resources. Vulnerable groups were mainly composed of children and pregnant women. Severe malnutrition including signs was reported, but there was evidence for local adaptation. Thus, families were trying by different means to fight against malnutrition.Conclusion: the socio-cultural context modulates knowledge and perception of the causes, the manifestations and the vulnerability or non-vulnerability of an individual as well as the severity of malnutrition.",

Data were extracted from health facility TB registers and semi-structured key informant interviews conducted in selected 26 cross-border sites within the 7 member states of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) region.Results: the overall cross-border TB cure rate in the year preceding the study (37%) was way beneath the global target with considerable variations amongst the study countries. The restricted support to the cross-border health facilities was mediated and even exacerbated by expansive distances from the respective capital cities. Restricted geographical access to the facilities by cross-border populations was a longstanding challenge. Substantial staffing gaps, TB service delivery capacity needs and inadequate diagnostics were noticeable. The TB control guidelines were not harmonized between the countries and the inter-country referral systems were either absent or inappreciable, contributing to ineffective cross-border referrals and transfers. The frail linkages between stakeholders were contemptible, but increasing governments? commitments in tackling infectious diseases were encouraging.Conclusion: cross-border TB interventions should drive regional TB policies, strategies and programs that sustain countries? coordination, harmonization of management guidelines, advocacy for increased human resources support, enhanced capacity building of cross-border TB staff, adequate diagnostics equipping of the cross-border health facilities and seamless transfer and referral of patients traversing boundaries.",

Tocophobia can be far reaching with adverse physiologic and emotional consequences for mothers, infants and families. This study therefore explored tocophobia experiences among primigravid women and explored its influence on birth choices among antenatal women.Methods: the study employed a qualitative exploratory research design. Participants who were primigravida (women who had never experienced childbirth), were selected using purposive sampling technique on antenatal clinic days. Data was obtained using semi-structured interview questions. Data was analyzed using content analysis approach and thematic categorization.Results: results showed that few of the women experienced tocophobia and these fears were not strong enough to make them opt for caesarian section. Reasons attributed to tocophobia experience among the participants included \"horror stories\" told in the neighborhood, \"past experiences\" of close acquaintance and \"entertainment videos\" broadcast. Furthermore, all the participants preferred to have vaginal delivery.Conclusion: few of the primigravid women in Ekiti State, Nigeria, experience tocophobia and this experience does not influence their choice of delivery option, as all participant?s preferred vaginal delivery to caesarian section. It is important for midwives to be aware of their role in counselling and identifying women with tocophobia in order to promote good and safe transition from pregnancy to motherhood.",

At the same time, food security is a deep concern, with increasing incidence of natural disasters and health concerns related to diet-related disease and dietary quality plaguing the nation and its food system. This article aims to examine the validity of the FIES for use in The Bahamas, the prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity, and the sociodemographic factors that contribute to increased food insecurity.METHODS: The FIES survey was administered by randomized and weighted landline telephone survey in Nassau in The Bahamas to 1000 participants in June and July 2017. The Rasch modelling procedure was applied to examine tool validity and prevalence of food insecurity. Equating procedures calibrated this study's results to the global FIES reference scale and computed internationally comparable prevalence rates of both moderate and severe food insecurity. A regression analysis assessed the relationship between household variables and food security.RESULTS: The FIES met benchmarks for fit statistics for all eight items and the overall Rasch reliability is 0.7. As of 2017, Bahamians' prevalence of moderate and severe food insecurity was 21%, and the prevalence of severe food insecurity was 10%. Statistically significant variables that contribute to food insecurity included education, age, gender, and presence of diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease. Results also indicated that Bahamians experience food insecurity differently than populations across the globe, likely due in large part to the workings of an isolated food system heavily dependent on foreign imports. Responses showed that by the time a Bahamian worries they will not have enough food to eat, they have already restricted their meals to a few kinds of foods and begun to limit their intake of vegetables and fruits.CONCLUSION: This study, which is among the first to comprehensively measure food security in The Bahamas, provides a baseline for further research and evaluation of practices aimed at mitigating food insecurity in small island developing states. Further, this study provides a benchmark for future research, which may seek to understand the impacts of Hurricane Dorian and COVID-19, disasters further isolating the remote island nation. Post-disaster food security data are needed to further understand the extent to which food security is impacted by natural disasters and identify which sectors and stakeholders are most vital in restructuring the agricultural sector and improving food availability following catastrophic events.",

Circular RNA hsa_circ_0000745 (circ_0000745) has been reported as an oncogene in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). However, whether circ_0000745 can drive T-ALL progression by controlling notch receptor 1 (NOTCH1) expression is unclear.METHODS: Relative expression of circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 in bone marrow (BM) samples and T-ALL cells was detected by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Loss- and gain-of-function experiments were executed to evaluate the effects of circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 on T-ALL cell proliferation and apoptosis. The microRNAs (miRs) that might jointly interact with circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 were predicted by bioinformatics analysis and verified by dual-luciferase reporter and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays.RESULTS: Circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 were overexpressed in T-ALL BM and T-ALL cells. Functionally, both circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 overexpression promoted T-ALL cell proliferation and curbed T-ALL cell apoptosis. In contrast, both circ_0000745 and NOTCH1 silencing restrained T-ALL cell proliferation and induced T-ALL cell apoptosis. Furthermore, circ_0000745 could control T-ALL cell proliferation and apoptosis through regulating NOTCH1 expression. Importantly, circ_0000745 regulated NOTCH1 expression by sponging miR-193b-3p.CONCLUSION: Our findings proposed a novel model in which circ_0000745 promoted cell proliferation and curbed cell apoptosis via upregulating NOTCH1 through serving as a miR-193b-3p sponge in T-ALL.",

Iron overload (IOL) caused by transfusion occurred in most MDS patients. But how IOL influences MDS progression has not been clarified yet.METHODS: Herein, we collected clinical data from 143 MDS patients to investigate the impacts of IOL on patients survival and AML transformation.RESULTS: We found that median survival time, 3-year survival rate, leukemia-free survival (LFS) time were significantly shorter in patients with IOL than those with non-iron overload (NIOL) (P = 0.040; P = 0.044; P = 0.037). Besides, IOL was more likely to be found in higher-risk subgroups (assessed by IPSS and WPSS) of MDS patients which also promoted 2-year AML transformation. Furthermore, the serum ferritin (SF) was significantly correlated with the overall survival (OS) of MDS patients (r = -0.311, P < 0.05). The concentrations of both intracellular iron and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in CD34+ cells of bone marrow were higher in the IOL group than the NIOL group, respectively (P = 0.0426; P = 0.0185). Moreover, ROS level was closely correlated with the percentage of bone marrow blasts (r = 0.7200, P = 0.0370). Collectively, IOL threatened the survival of MDS patients and promoted AML transformation.CONCLUSION: Elevated intracellular iron and ROS in CD34+ cells of bone marrow could accelerate the abnormal proliferation of blasts.",

Despite its ubiquitous use and time-honored diagnostic value, one essential attribute of MCV has remained under the radar. It has been long underappreciated that the size of RBC correlates with the amount of hemoglobin (Hb) that it accommodates and, therefore, is an important determining factor of the total Hb level. By scrutinizing this basic principle, it has become possible to uncover a hitherto obscured relationship between MCV, hematocrit (Hct) and RBCs described as a dynamic equilibrium.

Most pregnant women are concerned about fetal abnormalities and screening tests. Due to the importance of anxiety reduction in pregnant women, this study was conducted to determine the effect of short-term psychological intervention on the anxiety of pregnant women with positive screening results for chromosomal disorders.METHODS: A randomized clinical trial was performed on women referred to Akbarabadi Hospital in Tehran, Iran, who had positive screening results for chromosomal abnormalities. Participants were selected from eligible individuals by a continuous method and were assigned to two groups of cognitive-behavioral training (n = 46) and control (n = 46), using the block balanced randomization method. Participants in the cognitive-behavioral training group received 4 sessions of individual counseling. The control group received routine pregnancy visits. The Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety Inventory was completed before the intervention and immediately at the end of the intervention (before receiving the amniocentesis result). The analysis of intervention effects was performed as intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis.RESULTS: There was a statistically significant difference in post-intervention state anxiety scores and trait anxiety scores (p < �0.001) between the intervention and control groups, when their means were adjusted for pre-intervention scores for both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. Also, there was a large effect size between the groups in terms of state (ITT: �p2�= 0.63, PP: �p2�= 0.71) and trait (ITT: �p2�= 0.72, PP: �p2�= 0.75) anxiety scores clinically for both intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis. The intervention group had a statistically significant and large decrease in state and trait anxiety scores from pretrial to post-trial. In contrast, the control group had a statistically significant and medium increase in state and trait anxiety scores from pretrial to post-trial.CONCLUSION: The results showed that cognitive-behavioral training reduced the anxiety of pregnant women with positive screening results for chromosomal disorders. According to the results, it is recommended to hold cognitive-behavioral training classes to reduce the anxiety of pregnant women with a positive screening result for chromosomal disorders.TRIAL REGISTRATION: IRCT.ir: IRCT20180427039436N7 ;�date of registration: 24/08/2020 2020-08-24.",

A descriptive study and an analysis of factors associated with intrahospital mortality were performed.RESULTS: Out of the 101 patients, 96 were analysed. Of these, 79 (82%) recovered and were discharged, and 17 (18%) died in the hospital. Diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction to SARS-CoV2 in 92 (92.5%). The mean age was 63 years, and 66% were male. The most frequent comorbidities were hypertension (40%), diabetes mellitus (16%) y cardiopathy (14%). Patients who died were older (mean 77 vs 60 years), had higher prevalence of hypertension (71% vs 33%), and cardiopathy (47% vs 6%), and higher levels of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and reactive C protein (mean 662 vs 335 UI/L, and 193 vs 121mg/L respectively) on admission. In a multivariant analysis the variables significantly associated to mortality were the presence of cardiopathy (CI 95% OR 2,58-67,07), levels of LDH?345 IU/L (CI 95% OR 1,52-46,00), and age?65 years (CI 95% OR 1,23-44,62).CONCLUSIONS: The presence of cardiopathy, levels of LDH?345 IU/L and age?65 years, are associated with a higher risk of death during hospital stay for COVID-19. This model should be validated in prospective cohorts.",

In this study we aimed to detect the occurrence of pulmonary residuals as a late sequela of COVID-19 and to identify it's predictors among moderate and severe cases.METHODS: This observational prospective study involved 85 COVID-19 patients confirmed by real time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) nasopharyngeal swab, patients were recruited in the period of 1 st of June to 1 st of July. Demographic and clinical data were obtained for each patient. Chest imaging was performed initially and after 3 weeks to detect post COVID pulmonary residuals.RESULTS: The study population included 74 (87.1%) moderate and 11 (12.9%) severe patients. Patients with older age, male gender, high BMI and initial chest CT of consolidation/mixed consolidation and ground glass opacities (GGOs) had more frequent post COVID-19 pulmonary residuals (P 0.003, 0.026, 0.031, 0.035) respectively. There was a statistically significant difference between patients who showed complete resolution and patients who developed pulmonary residuals regarding the lymphocyte count, serum CRP and ferritin levels (P 0.0001). After logistic regression, male gender, high BMI, initial chest CT of consolidation/mixed consolidation and GGOs, lymphocytopenia, high serum CRP and ferritin levels were the predictors of pulmonary residuals. While the age wasn't statistically significant.CONCLUSION: 38.5% of moderate and severe COVID-19 patients tend to have pulmonary residuals.

Group S showed positive QFT in only 15% patients as against 50% QFT positive patients in group A and H. All fourteen patients in group S with QFT negative report died while 5 of six survived patients showed positive QFT report either on initial or repeat testing done at 6 weeks. The sixth survived patient was QFT negative but showed high antibody titre against H antigen (TH) on Widal test. All severely ill group S patients showed huge reduction of IGRA even to the mitogen stimulus thus suggesting gross general unresponsiveness of T cells. Presence of BCG scar showed no correlation with prevalence or progression of the disease.CONCLUSION: Population in an endemic area of tuberculosis and typhoid with good community exposure to these antigen is likely to withstand COVID -19 better and show reduced mortality following it.",

This pattern seems unpredictable, and the propagation appears unstoppable, resulting in over 350,000 death tolls in the U.S. by the end of 2020. Here, we create the spatiotemporal inter-county mobility network using 10 TB (Terabytes) trajectory data of 30 million smart devices in the U.S. in the first six months of 2020. We investigate the bond percolation process by removing the weakly connected edges. As we increase the threshold, the mobility network nodes become less interconnected and thus experience surprisingly abrupt phase transitions. Despite the complex behaviors of the mobility network, we devised a novel approach to identify a small, manageable set of recurrent critical bridges, connecting the giant component and the second-largest component. These adaptive links, located across the United States, played a key role as valves connecting components in divisions and regions during the pandemic. Beyond, our numerical results unveil that network characteristics determine the critical thresholds and the bridge locations. The findings provide new insights into managing and controlling the connectivity of mobility networks during unprecedented disruptions. The work can also potentially offer practical future infectious diseases both globally and locally.",

Although olfactory loss is recognized, our understanding of both the extent of loss and time to olfactory recovery following infection is less well known. Similarly, knowledge of potential impactful patient factors and therapies that influence olfactory recovery is desirable but is not overtly clear in the literature. Our systematic review sought to fill this knowledge gap. We included studies that: involved either an observational or an interventional design that reported data on patients with olfactory dysfunction due to Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) diagnosed COVID-19 infection; and reported data regarding olfactory recovery measured by an objective olfactory test, Likert scale and/or visual analog scale (VAS). The study methods were determined a priori and registered in PROSPERO (Registration Number CRD42020204354). An information specialist searched Medline, Embase, LitCovid and the Cochrane Register of Controlled Trials up to March 2021, and two reviewers were involved in all aspects of study selection and data collection. After screening 2788 citations, a total of 44 studies of assorted observational designs were included. Patients had undergone objective COVID-19 testing, and most were adult patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. Olfactory recovery was found to occur as early as 7 days, with most patients recovering olfaction within 30 days. Few studies included prolonged follow-up to 6 months or longer duration. Poor olfaction at initial presentation was associated with poor recovery rates. Only a small number of studies assessed olfactory retraining and steroid therapy. Additional trials are underway.",

During COVID-19, gender symmetry was observed in constrained access to contraception among contraceptive users (40.4% men; 34.6% women) and depressive symptoms (21.8% men; 24.3% women). Gender disparities rendered young women disproportionately unable to meet basic economic needs (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.21; p<0.05) and in need of healthcare during the pandemic (aOR = 1.59; p<0.001). At a bivariate level, women had lower full decisional control to leave the house (40.0% vs. 53.2%) and less consistent access to safe, private internet (26.1% vs. 40.2%), while men disproportionately experienced police interactions (60.1%, 55.2% of which included extortion). Gender-specific concerns for women included menstrual hygiene access challenges (52.0%), increased reliance on transactional partnerships, and gender-based violence, with 17.3% reporting past-year partner violence and 3.0% non-partner sexual violence. Qualitative results contextualize the mental health impact of economic disruption and isolation, and, among young women, privacy constraints.IMPLICATIONS: Youth and young adults face gendered impacts of COVID-19, reflecting both underlying disparities and the pandemic's economic and social shock. Economic, health and technology-based supports must ensure equitable access for young women. Gender-responsive recovery efforts are necessary and must address the unique needs of youth.",

Understanding the characteristics and outcome of the pandemic in the African setup is therefore crucial.AIM: To assess the characteristics and outcome of Patients with COVID-19 and to identify determinants of the disease outcome among patients admitted to Millennium COVID-19 Care Center in Ethiopia.METHODS: A prospective cohort study was conducted among 1345 consecutively admitted RT-PCR confirmed Patients with COVID-19 from July to September, 2020. Frequency tables, KM plots, median survival times and Log-rank test were used to describe the data and compare survival distribution between groups. Cox proportional hazard survival model was used to identify determinants of time to clinical recovery and the independent variables, where adjusted hazard ratio, P-value and 95% CI for adjusted hazard ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results. Binary logistic regression model was used to assess the presence of a statistically significant association between disease outcome and the independent variables, where adjusted odds ratio, P-value and 95% CI for adjusted odds ratio were used for testing significance and interpretation of results.RESULTS: Among the study population, 71 (5.3%) died, 72 (5.4%) were transferred and the rest 1202 (89.4%) were clinically improved. The median time to clinical recovery was 14 days. On the multivariable Cox proportional hazard model; temperature (AHR = 1.135, 95% CI = 1.011, 1.274, p-value = 0.032), COVID-19 severity (AHR = 0.660, 95% CI = 0.501, 0.869, p-value = 0.003), and cough (AHR = 0.705, 95% CI = 0.519, 0.959, p-value = 0.026) were found to be significant determinants of time to clinical recovery. On the binary logistic regression, the following factors were found to be significantly associated with disease outcome; SPO2 (AOR = 0.302, 95% CI = 0.193, 0.474, p-value = 0.0001), shortness of breath (AOR = 0.354, 95% CI = 0.213, 0.590, p-value = 0.0001) and diabetes mellitus (AOR = 0.549, 95% CI = 0.337, 0.894, p-value = 0.016).CONCLUSIONS: The average duration of time to clinical recovery was 14 days and 89.4% of the patients achieved clinical recovery. The mortality rate of the studied population is lower than reports from other countries including those in Africa. Having severe COVID-19 disease severity and presenting with cough were found to be associated with delayed clinical recovery of the disease. On the other hand, being hyperthermic is associated with shorter disease duration (faster time to clinical recovery). In addition, lower oxygen saturation, subjective complaint of shortness of breath and being diabetic were associated with unfavorable disease outcome. Therefore, patients with these factors should be followed cautiously for a better outcome.",

This massive change is not reflected by the scant scientific research on the effectiveness of methods relying on digital learning compared to other innovative and more popular methods involving face-to-face interactions. Here, we tested the effectiveness of computer-assisted instruction (CAI) in Science and Technology compared to inquiry-based learning (IBL), another modern method which, however, requires students to interact with each other in the classroom. Our research also considered socio-cognitive factors-working memory (WM), socioeconomic status (SES), and academic self-concept (ASC)-known to predict academic performance but usually ignored in research on IBL and CAI. Five hundred and nine middle-school students, a fairly high sample size compared with relevant studies, received either IBL or CAI for a period varying from four to ten weeks prior to the Covid-19 events. After controlling for students' prior knowledge and socio-cognitive factors, multilevel modelling showed that CAI was more effective than IBL. Although CAI-related benefits were stable across students' SES and ASC, they were particularly pronounced for those with higher WM capacity. While indicating the need to adapt CAI for students with poorer WM, these findings further justify the use of CAI both in normal times (without excluding other methods) and during pandemic episodes.",

Participants were enrolled between June 2011 and March 2016 (last follow-up, February 2020).Exposures: Provocation of myocardial ischemia with a standardized mental stress test (public speaking task) and with a conventional (exercise or pharmacological) stress test, using single-photon emission computed tomography.Main Outcomes and Measures: The primary outcome was a composite of cardiovascular death or first or recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction. The secondary end point additionally included hospitalizations for heart failure.Results: Of the 918 patients in the total sample pool (mean age, 60 years; 34% women), 618 participated in MIPS and 300 in MIMS2. Of those, 147 patients (16%) had mental stress-induced ischemia, 281 (31%) conventional stress ischemia, and 96 (10%) had both. Over a 5-year median follow-up, the primary end point occurred in 156 participants. The pooled event rate was 6.9 per 100 patient-years among patients with and 2.6 per 100 patient-years among patients without mental stress-induced ischemia. The multivariable adjusted hazard ratio (HR) for patients with vs those without mental stress-induced ischemia was 2.5 (95% CI, 1.8-3.5). Compared with patients with no ischemia (event rate, 2.3 per 100 patient-years), patients with mental stress-induced ischemia alone had a significantly increased risk (event rate, 4.8 per 100 patient-years; HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7) as did patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia (event rate, 8.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 3.8; 95% CI, 2.6-5.6). Patients with conventional stress ischemia alone did not have a significantly increased risk (event rate, 3.1 per 100 patient-years; HR, 1.4; 95% CI, 0.9-2.1). Patients with both mental stress ischemia and conventional stress ischemia had an elevated risk compared with patients with conventional stress ischemia alone (HR, 2.7; 95% CI, 1.7-4.3). The secondary end point occurred in 319 participants. The event rate was 12.6 per 100 patient-years for patients with and 5.6 per 100 patient-years for patients without mental stress-induced ischemia (adjusted HR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.5-2.5).Conclusions and Relevance: Among patients with stable coronary heart disease, the presence of mental stress-induced ischemia, compared with no mental stress-induced ischemia, was significantly associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Although these findings may provide insights into mechanisms of myocardial ischemia, further research is needed to assess whether testing for mental stress-induced ischemia has clinical value.",

Participants included Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with cancer treated at these practices through June 2019.Exposures: OCM participation.Main Outcomes and Measures: Total episode payments (Medicare spending for Parts A, B, and D, not including monthly payments for enhanced oncology services); utilization and payments for hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, office visits, chemotherapy, supportive care, and imaging; quality (chemotherapy-associated hospitalizations and ED visits, timely chemotherapy, end-of-life care, and survival); and patient experiences.Results: Among Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, 483 319 beneficiaries (mean age, 73.0 [SD, 8.7] years; 60.1% women; 987 332 episodes) were treated at 201 OCM participating practices, and 557 354 beneficiaries (mean age, 72.9 [SD, 9.0] years; 57.4% women; 1 122 597 episodes) were treated at 534 comparison practices. From the baseline period, total episode payments increased from $28 681 for OCM episodes and $28 421 for comparison episodes to $33 211 for OCM episodes and $33 249 for comparison episodes during the intervention period (difference in differences, -$297; 90% CI, -$504 to -$91), less than the mean $704 Monthly Enhanced Oncology Services payments. Relative decreases in total episode payments were primarily for Part B nonchemotherapy drug payments (difference in differences, -$145; 90% CI, -$218 to -$72), especially supportive care drugs (difference in differences, -$150; 90% CI, -$216 to -$84). The OCM was associated with statistically significant relative reductions in total episode payments among higher-risk episodes (difference in differences, -$503; 90% CI, -$802 to -$204) and statistically significant relative increases in total episode payments among lower-risk episodes (difference in differences, $151; 90% CI, $39-$264). The OCM was not significantly associated with differences in hospitalizations, ED visits, or survival. Of 22 measures of utilization, 10 measures of quality, and 7 measures of care experiences, only 5 were significantly different.Conclusions and Relevance: In this exploratory analysis, the OCM was significantly associated with modest payment reductions during 6-month episodes for Medicare beneficiaries receiving chemotherapy for cancer in the first 3 years of the OCM that did not offset the monthly payments for enhanced oncology services. There were no statistically significant differences for most utilization, quality, and patient experience outcomes.",

As a result, the aim of our research was to understand such a correlation among bank employees in Dhaka, Bangladesh.METHODS: A cross-sectional analysis was conducted with bank employees who worked in sedentary settings. The Eriksen subjective health complaints scale was used to measure the eight items of musculoskeletal health complaints (MHCs), and RTDs were measured using principal component analysis using variables commute time, distance, and traffic congestion experience to work. The association between RTDs and MHCs was identified using a multilevel model after adjusting potential confounders.RESULTS: A total of 628 employees (mean[SD] age, 36.1[7.0] years; 254[40.5%] women) participated in the study. Among the employees, the one-month prevalence of MHCs was 57.2%. The highest prevalence of MHCs was low-back pain (36.6%), followed by neck pain (22.9%) and upper-back pain (21.2%). Also, 136(21.7%) employees reported long-RTDs in commuting workplace and 81% of them had MHCs. The multilevel analysis identified that long-RTDs had a significant relationship with MHCs (adjusted odds ratio, AOR�=�10.20, 95%CI�=�5.41-16.91). Private transportation commuters reported 70% reduced odds of MHCs (AOR�=�0.30, 95%CI�=�0.15-0.59) and walking or bicycling commuters had 84% fewer MHCs (AOR�=�0.16, 95%CI�=�0.10-0.28) compared to public bus commuters.CONCLUSIONS: Sedentary employees with long-RTDs reported increased MHCs, emphasizing the importance of including musculoskeletal exercise in office facilities. Findings of this study also highlight the need for a sound public transportation system in Dhaka city.",

Here, we use our MITgcm ocean plastic model to quantify the impact of the pandemic on plastic discharge. We show that 8.4 � 1.4 million tons of pandemic-associated plastic waste have been generated from 193 countries as of August 23, 2021, with 25.9 � 3.8 thousand tons released into the global ocean representing 1.5 � 0.2% of the global total riverine plastic discharge. The model projects that the spatial distribution of the discharge changes rapidly in the global ocean within 3 y, with a significant portion of plastic debris landing on the beach and seabed later and a circumpolar plastic accumulation zone will be formed in the Arctic. We find hospital waste represents the bulk of the global discharge (73%), and most of the global discharge is from Asia (72%), which calls for better management of medical waste in developing countries.",

Isoform 2 of IFI16 (IFI16-iso2) with nuclear localization sequence (NLS) has been studied extensively as a well-known DNA sensor. However, the characteristics and functions of other IFI16 isoforms are almost unknown. Here, we find that IFI16-iso1, with exactly the same length as IFI16-iso2, lacks the NLS and locates in the cytoplasm. To distinguish the functions of IFI16-iso1 and IFI16-iso2, we have developed novel nuclear viral DNA mimics that can be recognized by the nuclear DNA sensors, including IFI16-iso2 and hnRNPA2B1. The hexanucleotide motif 5'-AGTGTT-3' DNA form of the nuclear localization sequence (DNLS) effectively drives cytoplasmic viral DNA nuclear translocation. These nuclear viral DNA mimics potently induce IFN-� and antiviral IFN-stimulated genes in human A549 cells, HEK293T cells, and mouse macrophages. The subcellular location difference of IFI16 isoforms determines their differential functions in recognizing viral DNA and activating type I IFN-dependent antiviral immunity. IFI16-iso1 preferentially colocalizes with cytoplasmic HSV60mer and cytoplasm-replicating vaccinia virus (VACV), whereas IFI16-iso2 mainly colocalizes with nuclear HSV60-DNLS and nucleus-replicating HSV-1. Compared with IFI16-iso2, IFI16-iso1 induces more transcription of IFN-� and IFN-stimulated genes, as well as stronger antiviral immunity upon HSV60mer transfection or VACV infection. IFI16-iso2, with the ability of nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling, clears both invaded HSV type 1 and VACV significantly. However, IFI16-iso2 induces more type I IFN-dependent antiviral immunity than IFI16-iso1 upon HSV60-DNLS transfection or HSV type 1 infection. Our study has developed potent agonists for nuclear DNA sensors and also has demonstrated that IFI16 isoforms with cytoplasmic and nuclear locations play differential roles in innate immunity against DNA viruses.",

In particular lockdown policies, i.e., generalized mobility restrictions, have been employed to fight the first wave of the pandemic. We analyze data reflecting mobility levels over time in Italy before, during and after the national lockdown, in order to assess some direct and indirect effects. By applying methodologies based on percolation and network science approaches, we find that the typical network characteristics, while very revealing, do not tell the whole story. In particular, the Italian mobility network during lockdown has been damaged much more than node- and edge-level metrics indicate. Additionally, many of the main Provinces of Italy are affected by the lockdown in a surprisingly similar fashion, despite their geographical and economic dissimilarity. Based on our findings we offer an approach to estimate unavailable high-resolution economic dimensions, such as real time Province-level GDP, based on easily measurable mobility information.",

Characterizing the cross-reactivity of antibodies against these VOCs is necessary to understand the humoral response of non-hospitalized individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, a population that remains understudied. Thirty-two SARS-CoV-2-positive (PCR-confirmed) and non-hospitalized Canadian adults were enrolled 14-21�days post-diagnosis in 2020, before the emergence of the B.1.351 (also known as Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta) and P.1 (Gamma) VOCs. Sera were collected 4 and 16�weeks post-diagnosis. Antibody levels and pseudo-neutralization of the ectodomain of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein/human ACE-2 receptor interaction were analyzed with native, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and P.1 variant spike proteins. Despite a lower response observed for the variant spike proteins, we report evidence of a sustained humoral response against native, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and P.1 variant spike proteins among non-hospitalized Canadian adults. Furthermore, this response inhibited the interaction between the spike proteins from the different VOCs and ACE-2 receptor for ? 16�weeks post-diagnosis, except for individuals aged 18-49�years who showed no inhibition of the interaction between B.1.617.1 or B.1.617.2 spike and ACE-2. Interestingly, the affinity (KD) measured between the spike proteins (native, B.1.351, B.1.617.2 and P.1) and antibodies elicited in sera of infected and vaccinated (BNT162b2 and ChAdOx1 nCoV-19) individuals was invariant. Relative to sera from vaccine-na?ve (and previously infected) individuals, sera from vaccinated individuals had higher antibody levels (as measured with label-free SPR) and more efficiently inhibited the spike-ACE-2 interactions, even among individuals aged 18-49�years, showing the effectiveness of vaccination.",

Our aim in this study is to determine which scoring system is most useful in determining disease severity and to guide clinicians. We classified the patients into two groups according to the stage of the disease (severe and non-severe) and adopted interim guidance of the World Health Organization. Severe cases were divided into a group of surviving patients and a deceased group according to the prognosis. According to admission values, the BCRSS, qSOFA, SOFA, MuLBSTA, and HScore were evaluated at admission using the worst parameters available in the first 24�h. Of the 417 patients included in our study, 46 (11%) were in the severe group, while 371 (89%) were in the non-severe group. Of these 417 patients, 230 (55.2%) were men. The median (IQR) age of all patients was 44 (25) years. In multivariate logistic regression analyses, BRCSS in the highest tertile (HR 6.1, 95% CI 2.105-17.674, p = 0.001) was determined as an independent predictor of severe disease in cases of COVID-19. In multivariate analyses, qSOFA was also found to be an independent predictor of severe COVID-19 (HR 4.757, 95% CI 1.438-15.730, p = 0.011). The area under the curve (AUC) of the BRCSS, qSOFA, SOFA, MuLBSTA, and HScore was 0.977, 0.961, 0.958, 0.860, and 0.698, respectively. Calculation of the BRCSS and qSOFA at the time of hospital admission can predict critical clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19, and their predictive value is superior to that of HScore, MuLBSTA, and SOFA. Our prediction is that early interventions for high-risk patients, with early identification of high-risk group using BRCSS and qSOFA, may improve clinical outcomes in COVID-19.",

When combined with sulfated lactosyl archaeol (SLA) archaeosome adjuvant, formulations induced robust antigen-specific humoral and cellular immune responses in mice. Antibodies had strong neutralizing activity, preventing viral spike binding and viral infection. In addition, the formulations were highly efficacious in a hamster challenge model reducing viral load and body weight loss even after a single vaccination. The antigen-specific antibodies generated by our vaccine formulations had stronger neutralizing activity than human convalescent plasma, neutralizing the spike proteins of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants of concern.

This illness is spurred on by a coronavirus known as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). SARS was first detected in Asia in late February 2003. The genome of this virus is very similar to the SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, the study of SARS-CoV disease and the identification of effective drugs to treat this disease can be new clues for the treatment of SARS-Cov-2. This study aimed to discover novel potential drugs for SARS-CoV disease in order to treating SARS-Cov-2 disease based on a novel systems biology approach. To this end, gene co-expression network analysis was applied. First, the gene co-expression network was reconstructed for 1441 genes, and then two gene modules were discovered as significant modules. Next, a list of miRNAs and transcription factors that target gene co-expression modules' genes were gathered from the valid databases, and two sub-networks formed of transcription factors and miRNAs were established. Afterward, the list of the drugs targeting obtained sub-networks' genes was retrieved from the DGIDb database, and two drug-gene and drug-TF interaction networks were reconstructed. Finally, after conducting different network analyses, we proposed five drugs, including FLUOROURACIL, CISPLATIN, SIROLIMUS, CYCLOPHOSPHAMIDE, and METHYLDOPA, as candidate drugs for SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus treatment. Moreover, ten miRNAs including miR-193b, miR-192, miR-215, miR-34a, miR-16, miR-16, miR-92a, miR-30a, miR-7, and miR-26b were found to be significant miRNAs in treating SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.",

Across 68 unadjusted (n = 26,960) and 39 adjusted studies (n = 15,653) reporting initial D-dimer, a significant association was found in patients with higher D-dimer for the risk of overall disease progression (unadjusted odds ratio (uOR) 3.15; adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 1.64). The time-to-event outcomes were pooled across 19 unadjusted (n = 9743) and 21 adjusted studies (n = 13,287); a strong association was found in patients with higher D-dimers for the risk of overall disease progression (unadjusted hazard ratio (uHR) 1.41; adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 1.10). The prognostic use of higher D-dimer was found to be promising for predicting overall disease progression (studies 68, area under curve 0.75) in COVID-19. Our study showed that higher D-dimer levels provide prognostic information useful for clinicians to early assess COVID-19 patients at risk for disease progression and mortality outcomes.

The present paper uses weekly data from 54 French administrative regions between March 23, 2020 and January 10, 2021. Firstly, a Granger causal analysis is developed and reveals that past values of the IPTCC contain information that allow for a better prediction of hospitalizations or deaths than that obtained without the IPTCC. Finally, a vector autoregressive model is estimated to evaluate the dynamic response of hospitalizations and deaths after an increase in the IPTCC. It is estimated that a 10-point increase in the IPTCC causes hospitalizations to rise by 2.9% (90% CI 0.7-5.0) one week after the increase, and by 4.1% (90% CI 2.1-6.4) and 4.4% (90% CI 2.5-6.3) in the two following weeks. Over ten weeks, the cumulative effect is estimated to reach 20.1%. Two weeks after the increase in the IPTCC, deaths are estimated to rise by 3.7% (90% CI 1.6-5.8). The cumulative effect from the second to the tenth weeks reaches 15.8%. The results are robust to the inclusion of air pollution indicators.",

This study was performed to investigate the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) antibodies in healthcare workers (HCWs) at 6 major hospitals in Daegu.METHODS: Blood specimens of 2,935 HCWs at 6 major hospitals in Daegu from January 2021 to February 2021 were collected. Every specimen was tested for antibody against SARS-CoV-2 using both Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 electrochemiluminescence immunoassay (Roche Diagnostics, Rotkreuz, Switzerland) and R-FIND COVID-19 IgG/M/A enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit (SG medical Inc., Seoul, Korea) as screening tests. If 1 or more of these screening test results was positive, 2 additional antibody tests were performed using Abbott Anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay (Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA) and cPass SARS-CoV-2 Neutralization Antibody Detection Kit (GenScript USA Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA). If 2 or more of the total 4 test results were positive, it was determined as positive for the antibody against SARS-CoV-2.RESULTS: According to the criteria of SARS-CoV-2 antibody positivity determination, 12 subjects were determined as positive. The overall positive rate of the SARS-CoV-2 antibody was 0.41% (12/2,935). Of the 12 subjects determined as positive, 7 were diagnosed with COVID-19, and the remaining 5 were nondiagnosed cases of COVID-19.CONCLUSION: In early 2021, the overall seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibody among HCW located in Daegu was 0.41%, and 0.17% excluding COVID-19 confirmed subjects. These results were not particularly high compared with the general public and were much lower than HCWs in other countries.",

ITP is one of the manifestations of a coronavirus disease, as well as an adverse event occurring after vaccination against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Several cases of ITP have been described after vaccination with two mRNA-based vaccines-BTN162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna)-against SARS-CoV-2. Herein, we report a case of ITP occurring after vaccination with ChAdOx1 adenovirus vector nCoV-19 (AstraZeneca) vaccine in Korea. A 66-year-old woman presented with multiple ecchymoses on both upper and lower extremities and gingival bleeding, appearing 3 days after receiving the first dose of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19.

Metabolic activity of the cells inside biofilms causes gradients in local environmental conditions, which leads to the emergence of physiologically differentiated subpopulations. Information about the properties and spatial arrangement of such metabolic subpopulations, as well as their interaction strength and interaction length scales are lacking, even for model systems like Escherichia coli colony biofilms grown on agar-solidified media. Here, we use an unbiased approach, based on temporal and spatial transcriptome and metabolome data acquired during E. coli colony biofilm growth, to study the spatial organization of metabolism. We discovered that alanine displays a unique pattern among amino acids and that alanine metabolism is spatially and temporally heterogeneous. At the anoxic base of the colony, where carbon and nitrogen sources are abundant, cells secrete alanine via the transporter AlaE. In contrast, cells utilize alanine as a carbon and nitrogen source in the oxic nutrient-deprived region at the colony mid-height, via the enzymes DadA and DadX. This spatially structured alanine cross-feeding influences cellular viability and growth in the cross-feeding-dependent region, which shapes the overall colony morphology. More generally, our results on this precisely controllable biofilm model system demonstrate a remarkable spatiotemporal complexity of metabolism in biofilms. A better characterization of the spatiotemporal metabolic heterogeneities and dependencies is essential for understanding the physiology, architecture, and function of biofilms.",

Vascular 5-methoxytryptophan (5-MTP) is a newly identified factor with anti-inflammatory actions. As 5-MTP targets p38 MAPK for its actions, we postulated that 5-MTP protects against vascular chondrogenesis and calcification.METHODS: High-fat diet-induced advanced atherosclerosis in mice were performed to investigate the effect of 5-MTP on atherosclerotic lesions and calcification. VSMCs were used to determine the role of 5-MTP in VSMC chondrogenic differentiation and calcification. Alizarin red S and Alcian blue staining were used to measure VSMC calcification and chondrogenic differentiation, respectively.RESULTS: 5-MTP was detected in aortic tissues of ApoE-/- mice fed control chow. It was reduced in ApoE-/- mice fed high-fat diet (HFD), but was restored in ApoE-/-Tlr2-/- mice, suggesting that HFD reduces vascular 5-MTP production via TLR2. Intraperitoneal injection of 5-MTP or its analog into ApoE-/- mice fed HFD reduced aortic atherosclerotic lesions and calcification which was accompanied by reduction of chondrogenesis and calcium deposition. Pam3CSK4 (Pam3), ligand of TLR2, induced SMC phenotypic switch to chondrocytes. Pretreatment with 5-MTP preserved SMC contractile proteins and blocked Pam3-induced chondrocyte differentiation and calcification. 5-MTP inhibited HFD-induced p38 MAPK activation in vivo and Pam3-induced p38 MAPK activation in SMCs. 5-MTP suppressed HFD-induced CREB activation in aortic tissues and Pam3-induced CREB and NF-�B activation in SMCs.CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that 5-MTP is a vascular arsenal against atherosclerosis and calcification by inhibiting TLR2-mediated SMC phenotypic switch to chondrocytes and the consequent calcification. 5-MTP exerts these effects by blocking p38 MAPK activation and inhibiting CREB and NF-�B transactivation activity.",

To achieve adherence to therapy, in-depth understanding of disease and treatment options are important.OBJECTIVE: Development of specifically designed illustrations and standardised, easy-to-read texts for children and adolescents with JIA. Education materials were tested for comprehensibility and content validity. We hypothesised that children would be able to increase their knowledge about JIA after presentation of materials.METHODS: The illustrations were designed by a graphic artist and the informative texts consecutively transformed to easy-to-read language. The materials appear as a modular system to allow individualized information for each patient. The illustrations and texts were tested for knowledge gain and improvement of self-efficacy in children affected by JIA/ rheumatic diseases and controls. Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) was tested as an overall assessment of patients' well-being.RESULTS: 46 controls (71% female) and 38 patients (48% female) with a median age of 11 years were tested in a standardised setting. In both groups knowledge gain was significant (controls: t (44) = 11.08, p�< 0.001, d�= 1.65; patients: t (37) = 7.48, p�< 0.001, d�= 1.21). The control group had a significantly higher enhancement of disease knowledge compared to patients' group (p�= .046) The follow-up testing was only performed in one school class (20 controls) due to Covid-19 pandemic with significant improvement compared to the pre-test results (p�= .002). The enhancement of self-efficacy through the teaching session was significantly higher in the patients' group. No impairment of HRQoL was seen.CONCLUSION: Explaining juvenile rheumatic diseases and therapeutic strategies is an important task in paediatric rheumatology. To avoid incomprehensible explanations in medical jargon, illustrations and easy-to-read texts were developed. Standardised presentation of the newly created materials resulted in a significant improvement of disease knowledge in patients and controls in addition to an enhancement of self-efficacy in patients.",

We aimed to describe the incidence of death or new disability, functional impairment and changes in health-related quality of life of patients after COVID-19 critical illness at 6 months.METHODS: In a nationally representative, multicenter, prospective cohort study of COVID-19 critical illness, we determined the prevalence of death or new disability at 6 months, the primary outcome. We measured mortality, new disability and return to work with changes in the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0 12L (WHODAS) and health status with the EQ5D-5LTM.RESULTS: Of 274 eligible patients, 212 were enrolled from 30 hospitals. The median age was 61 (51-70) years, and 124 (58.5%) patients were male. At 6 months, 43/160 (26.9%) patients died and 42/108 (38.9%) responding survivors reported new disability. Compared to pre-illness, the WHODAS percentage score worsened (mean difference (MD), 10.40% [95% CI 7.06-13.77]; p < 0.001). Thirteen (11.4%) survivors had not returned to work due to poor health. There was a decrease in the EQ-5D-5LTM utility score (MD, - 0.19 [- 0.28 to - 0.10]; p < 0.001). At 6 months, 82 of 115 (71.3%) patients reported persistent symptoms. The independent predictors of death or new disability were higher�severity of illness and increased�frailty.CONCLUSIONS: At six months after COVID-19 critical illness, death and new disability was substantial.

The aim of the present study is to characterize in vivo the microvascular reactivity in peripheral skeletal muscle of severe COVID-19 patients.METHODS: This is a prospective observational study carried out in Spain, Mexico and Brazil. Healthy subjects and severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the intermediate respiratory (IRCU) and intensive care units (ICU) due to hypoxemia were studied. Local tissue/blood oxygen saturation (StO2) and local hemoglobin concentration (THC) were non-invasively measured on the forearm by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). A vascular occlusion test (VOT), a three-minute induced ischemia, was performed in order to obtain dynamic StO2 parameters: deoxygenation rate (DeO2), reoxygenation rate (ReO2), and hyperemic response (HAUC). In COVID-19 patients, the severity of ARDS was evaluated by the ratio between peripheral arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2) and the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) (SF ratio).RESULTS: Healthy controls (32) and COVID-19 patients (73) were studied. Baseline StO2 and THC did not differ between the two groups. Dynamic VOT-derived parameters were significantly impaired in COVID-19 patients showing lower metabolic rate (DeO2) and diminished endothelial reactivity. At enrollment, most COVID-19 patients were receiving invasive mechanical ventilation (MV) (53%) or high-flow nasal cannula support (32%). Patients on MV were also receiving sedative agents (100%) and vasopressors (29%). Baseline StO2 and DeO2 negatively correlated with SF ratio, while ReO2 showed a positive correlation with SF ratio. There were significant differences in baseline StO2 and ReO2 among the different ARDS groups according to SF ratio, but not among different respiratory support therapies.CONCLUSION: Patients with severe COVID-19 show systemic microcirculatory alterations suggestive of endothelial dysfunction, and these alterations are associated with the severity of ARDS. Further evaluation is needed to determine whether these observations have prognostic implications. These results represent interim findings of the ongoing HEMOCOVID-19 trial.

A total of 448,666 (86.3%) products out of the 519,618 initially received were validated and distributed in health care units, equivalent to 126 (52.7%) donations out of the 239 received. The budgetary value of the validated donations was 32,872 euros according to the pre COVID-19 prices and 122,178 euros according to the current COVID-19 prices, representing an increase of 371.7%.CONCLUSIONS: By ensuring a constant influx of personal protective equipment and proper stock management, shortages were avoided.

Among the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, the non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) has great importance during the virus infection process and is present in both alpha and beta-CoVs. Therefore, monitoring of NSP1 polymorphisms is crucial in order to understand their role during infection and virus-induced pathogenicity. Herein, we analyzed how mutations detected in the circulating SARS-CoV-2 in the population of the city of Manaus, Amazonas state, Brazil could modify the tertiary structure of the NSP1 protein. Three mutations were detected in the SARS-CoV-2 NSP1 gene: deletion of the amino acids KSF from positions 141 to 143 (delKSF), SARS-CoV-2, lineage B.1.195; and two substitutions, R29H and R43C, SARS-CoV-2 lineage B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33, respectively. The delKSF was found in 47 samples, whereas R29H and R43C were found in two samples, one for each mutation. The NSP1 structures carrying the mutations R43C and R29H on the N-terminal portion (e.g. residues 10 to 127) showed minor backbone divergence compared to the Wuhan model. However, the NSP1 C-terminal region (residues 145 to 180) was severely affected in the delKSF and R29H mutants. The intermediate variable region (residues 144 to 148) leads to changes in the C-terminal region, particularly in the delKSF structure. New investigations must be carried out to analyze how these changes affect NSP1 activity during the infection. Our results reinforce the need for continuous genomic surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 to better understand virus evolution and assess the potential impact of the viral mutations on the approved vaccines and future therapies.",

In addition to socio-demographic characteristics, individuals were asked about their finances and predictors of financial well-being, mental health symptoms, and intimate partner violence (IPV) experiences. Chi-square analysis and one-way ANOVA were used to examine whether women's experiences with material hardship and associated factors differed by income level (i.e., less than $20,000; $20,000 to $60,000; more than $60,000). Ordinary least squares regression was used to calculate unadjusted and adjusted estimates.RESULTS: Study findings showed that the majority of women in the sample experienced at least one form of material hardship in the past year. Individuals with an annual household income less than $20,000 reported the highest average number of material hardships experienced (M = 3.7, SD = 2.8). Compared to women with household incomes less than $20,000, women with incomes of more than $60,000 reported significantly fewer material hardships, less financial strain, and higher levels of financial support, economic self-efficacy, and economic-self-sufficiency. Women with incomes of $60,000 or more also reported significantly lower levels of psychological abuse, and a smaller percentage met the cut-off for anxiety. Economic self-sufficiency, financial strain, posttraumatic stress disorder, and economic abuse were all significantly associated with material hardship.CONCLUSIONS: A contribution of this study is that it highlights the significant, positive association between economic abuse, a unique form of IPV, and material hardship among pregnant women during the pandemic. These findings suggest the need for policy and practice interventions that help to ameliorate the financial insecurity experienced by some pregnant women, as well as respond to associated bidirectional vulnerabilities (e.g., mental health symptoms, experiences of IPV).",

Global hemostatic tests examining the initiation of coagulation, clot strength and fibrinolysis, such as the Calibrated Automated Thrombogram (CAT) and plasma-thromboelastography (TEG) have not been evaluated in horses. This study aimed to evaluate CAT and apply plasma-TEG in horses. Test performance of CAT was evaluated on equine platelet poor plasma with intra- and inter-assay variability (CV) and a heparin dilution curve. To examine clinical performance of both tests, group comparisons were assessed comparing healthy horses, horses with mild and severe GI disease with both CAT and plasma-TEG.RESULTS: For CAT, intra- and inter-assay CVs were established for lag-time (1.7, 4.7%), endogenous thrombin potential (1.6, 4.6%), peak (2.6, 3.9%) and time to peak (ttPeak) (1.9, 3.4%). Increasing heparin concentrations led to the expected decrease in thrombin generation. In the group comparison analysis, CAT showed significant higher peak (p = 0.04) and ttPeak (p = 0.008) in the severe GI disease group compared to horses with mild GI disease and healthy horses, respectively. Plasma-TEG showed an increased angle (p = 0.032), maximum amplitude (p = 0.017) and shear elastic force (G) (p = 0.017) in the severe GI disease group compared to healthy horses.CONCLUSIONS: CAT performed well in horses. Both CAT and plasma-TEG identified hemostatic aberrations in horses with severe GI disease compared to healthy horses. Further studies including more horses, are needed to fully appreciate the use of CAT and plasma-TEG in this species.",

Sixty-two adults and 22 pediatric cancer patients with COVID-19 infection were assessed for the prognostic value of certain inflammatory indices including the neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR), platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), derived NLR (dNLR), systemic inflammation index (SII), mean platelet volume to platelet ratio (MPR), C-reactive protein to lymphocyte ratio (CRP/L), aggregate index of systemic inflammation (AISI), systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and neutrophil to lymphocyte, platelet ratio (NLPR). Data were correlated to patients' outcome regarding ICU admission, and incidence of mortality. Increased CRP/L ratio in adult COVID-19 cancer patients was significantly associated with inferior survival [152 (19-2253) in non-survivors, compared to 27.4 (0.8-681) in survivors (P = 0.033)]. It achieved a sensitivity (60%) and a specificity (90.2%) at a cut-off 152, while it achieved a sensitivity of 60% and specificity 95.1% at a cut-off 252 (AUC 0.795, P = 0.033). When combining both CRP/L and NLPR for the prediction of poor outcome in adult cancer patients with COVID19, the sensitivity increased to 80% and the specificity was 70.7% (AUC 0.805, P = 0.027). Increased incidence of ICU admission in pediatric cancer patients associated significantly with the severity of covid19 infection, decreased mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH) < 28.3, increased red cell distribution width (RDW) > 16, lymphopenia < 1.04, pseudo Pelger-Huet appearance, and PLR < 196.4 (P = 0.004, P = 0.040, P = 0.029, P = 0. 0.039, P = 0.050, and P = 0.040; respectively). The mean corpuscular volume (MCV), MCH, and RDW could be useful prognostic markers for poor outcome in COVID-19 pediatric cancer patients (P < 0.05 for all). Increased both CRP/L and NLPR associated significantly with poor survival in adult COVID-19 cancer patients, while PLR associated significantly with ICU admission in pediatric COVID-19 cancer patients.",

We conducted a multicenter study including oligometastatic kidney cancer treated with SBRT. We retrospectively analyzed 207 patients who underwent 245 SBRT treatments on 385 lesions, including 165 (42.9%) oligorecurrent (OR) and 220 (57.1%) oligoprogressive (OP) lesions. Most common sites were lung (30.9%) for OR group, and bone (32.7%) for OP group. Among 78 (31.8%) patients receiving concomitant systemic therapy, sunitinib (61.5%) and pazopanib (15.4%) were the most common for OR patients, while sunitinib (49.2%) and nivolumab (20.0%) for OP patients. End points were local control (LC), progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), time to next systemic therapy (TTNS) and toxicity. Median follow-up was 18.6�months. 1, 2 and 3-year LC rates were 89.4%, 80.1% and 76.6% in OR patients, and 82.7%, 76.9% and 64.3% in those with OP, respectively. LC for OP group was influenced by clear cell histology (p = 0.000), total number of lesions (p = 0.004), systemic therapy during SBRT (p = 0.012), and SBRT dose (p = 0.012). Median PFS was 37.9�months. 1, 2- and 3-year OS was 92.7%, 86.4% and 81.8%, respectively. Median TTNS was 15.8�months for OR patients, and 13.9�months for OP patients.

We sought to investigate the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of a SARS-CoV-2 outbreak that occurred in a highly dense population area in Colombo, Sri Lanka from April to May 2020.METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We carried out RT-qPCR for SARS-CoV2, assessed the SARS-CoV-2 specific total and neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) in a densely packed, underserved settlement (n = 2722) after identification of the index case on 15th April 2020. 89/2722 individuals were detected as infected by RT-qPCR with a secondary attack rate among close contacts being 0.077 (95% CI 0.063-0.095). Another 30 asymptomatic individuals were found to have had COVID-19 based on the presence of SARS-CoV-2 specific antibodies. However, only 61.5% of those who were initially seropositive for SARS-CoV-2 had detectable total antibodies at 120 to 160 days, while only 40.6% had detectable Nabs. 74/89 (83.1%) of RT-qPCR positive individuals were completely asymptomatic and all 15 (16.9%) who experienced symptoms were classified as having a mild illness. 18 (20.2%) were between the ages of 61 to 80. 11/89 (12.4%) had diabetes, 8/89 (9%) had cardiovascular disease and 4 (4.5%) had asthma. Of the two viruses that were sequenced and were of the B.1 and B.4 lineages with one carrying the D614G mutation.DISCUSSION/CONCLUSION: Almost all infected individuals developed mild or asymptomatic illness despite the presence of comorbid illnesses. Since the majority of those who were in this underserved settlement were not infected despite circulation of the D614G variant, it would be important to further study environmental and host factors that lead to disease severity and transmission.",

Already before the pandemic, unpaid work was disproportionately borne by women. This paper studies the effect of working from home for pay (WFH), due to a lockdown, on the change in the division of housework and childcare within couple households. While previous studies on the effect of WFH on the reconciliation of work and family life and the division of labour within the household suffered from selection bias, we are able to identify this effect by drawing upon the shock of the first COVID-19 lockdown in Austria. The corresponding legal measures left little choice over WFH. In any case, WFH is exogenous, conditional on a small set of individual and household characteristics we control for. We employ data from a survey on the gendered aspects of the lockdown. The dataset includes detailed information on time use during the lockdown and on the quality and experience of WFH. Uniquely, this survey data also includes information on the division, and not only magnitude, of unpaid work within households. Austria is an interesting case in this respect as it is characterized by very conservative gender norms. The results reveal that the probability of men taking on a larger share of housework increases if men are WFH alone or together with their female partner. By contrast, the involvement of men in childcare increased only in the event that the female partner was not able to WFH. Overall, the burden of childcare, and particularly homeschooling, was disproportionately borne by women.",

Genetic sequences of the miSARS-CoV-2 identified a new genetic variant known as \"Cluster 5\" that contained mutations in the spike protein. However, the functional properties of these \"Cluster 5\" mutations have not been well established. In this study, we found that the Y453F mutation located in the RBD domain of miSARS-CoV-2 is an adaptive mutation that enhances binding to mink ACE2 and other orthologs of Mustela species without compromising, and even enhancing, its ability to utilize human ACE2 as a receptor for entry. Structural analysis suggested that despite the similarity in the overall binding mode of SARS-CoV-2 RBD to human and mink ACE2, Y34 of mink ACE2 was better suited to interact with a Phe rather than a Tyr at position 453 of the viral RBD due to less steric clash and tighter hydrophobic-driven interaction. Additionally, the Y453F spike exhibited resistance to convalescent serum, posing a risk for vaccine development. Thus, our study suggests that since the initial transmission from humans, SARS-CoV-2 evolved to adapt to the mink host, leading to widespread circulation among minks while still retaining its ability to efficiently utilize human ACE2 for entry, thus allowing for transmission of the miSARS-CoV-2 back into humans. These findings underscore the importance of active surveillance of SARS-CoV-2 evolution in Mustela species and other susceptible hosts in order to prevent future outbreaks.",

Understanding the magnitude and duration of protective immune responses is vital to curbing the pandemic. We enrolled 461 high-risk health services workers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and first responders in the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACoFD) to assess the humoral responses in previously infected (PI) and infection na?ve (NPI) individuals to mRNA-based vaccines (BNT162b2/Pfizer- BioNTech or mRNA-1273/Moderna). A chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay was used to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 Spike in vaccinees prior to (n = 21) and following each vaccine dose (n = 246 following dose 1 and n = 315 following dose 2), and at days 31-60 (n = 110) and 61-90 (n = 190) following completion of the 2-dose series. Both vaccines induced robust antibody responses in all immunocompetent individuals. Previously infected individuals achieved higher median peak titers (p = 0.002) and had a slower rate of decay (p = 0.047) than infection-na?ve individuals. mRNA-1273 vaccinated infection-na?ve individuals demonstrated modestly higher titers following each dose (p = 0.005 and p = 0.029, respectively) and slower rates of antibody decay (p = 0.003) than those who received BNT162b2. A subset of previously infected individuals (25%) required both doses in order to reach peak antibody titers. The biologic significance of the differences between previously infected individuals and between the mRNA-1273 and BNT162b2 vaccines remains uncertain, but may have important implications for booster strategies.",

Seroepidemiologic evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 in children in a major metropolitan region of the US was performed.METHODS: Children and adolescents ?19 years were enrolled in a cross-sectional, observational study of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence from July-October 2020 in Northern Virginia, US. Demographic, health, and COVID-19 exposure information was collected, and blood analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 spike protein total antibody. Risk factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity were analyzed. Orthogonal antibody testing was performed, and samples were evaluated for responses to different antigens.RESULTS: In 1038 children, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 total antibody positivity rate was 8.5%. After multivariate logistic regression, significant risk factors included Hispanic ethnicity, public or absent insurance, a history of COVID-19 symptoms, exposure to person with COVID-19, a household member positive for SARS-CoV-2 and multi-family or apartment dwelling without a private entrance. 66% of seropositive children had no symptoms of COVID-19. Secondary analysis included orthogonal antibody testing with assays for 1) a receptor binding domain specific antigen and 2) a nucleocapsid specific antigen had concordance rates of 80.5% and 79.3% respectively.CONCLUSIONS: A much higher burden of SARS-CoV-2 infection, as determined by seropositivity, was found in children than previously reported; this was also higher compared to adults in the same region at a similar time. Contrary to prior reports, we determined children shoulder a significant burden of COVID-19 infection. The role of children's disease transmission must be considered in COVID-19 mitigation strategies including vaccination.",

We found MIBC cells are hypermutable, deficient in DNA repair and have markedly downregulated DNA repair genes, XPC, hOGG1/2 and Ref1, and the tumor suppressor, TAp63�. In contrast, NMIBC cells are hyperactive in DNA repair and exhibit upregulated DNA repair genes and TAp63�. A parallel exists in human tumors, as MIBC tissues have markedly lower DNA repair activity, and lower expression of DNA repair genes and TAp63� compared to NMIBC tissues. Forced TAp63� expression in MIBC significantly mitigates DNA repair deficiencies and reduces mutational susceptibility. Knockdown of TAp63� in NMIBC greatly reduces DNA repair capacity and enhances mutational susceptibility. Manipulated TAp63� expression or knockdown of p53m reduce the invasion of MIBC by 40-60%. However, the combination of p53m knockdown with forced TAp63� expression reduce the invasion ability to nil suggesting that p53m contributes to invasion phenotype independent from TAp63�. These results indicate that in BC, TAp63� regulates DNA repair capacities, mutational susceptibility and invasion, and that p53m contribute to the invasion phenotype. We conclude that concurrent TAp63� suppression and acquisition of p53m are a major cause for MIBC development.",

Computed tomography (CT) scan is one of the important auxiliary methods for the clinical diagnosis of COVID-19. However, CT image lesion edge is normally affected by pixels with uneven grayscale and isolated noise, which makes weak edge detection of the COVID-19 lesion more complicated. In order to solve this problem, an edge detection method is proposed, which combines the histogram equalization and the improved Canny algorithm. Specifically, the histogram equalization is applied to enhance image contrast. In the improved Canny algorithm, the median filter, instead of the Gaussian filter, is used to remove the isolated noise points. The K-means algorithm is applied to separate the image background and edge. And the Canny algorithm is improved continuously by combining the mathematical morphology and the maximum between class variance method (OTSU). On selecting four types of lesion images from COVID-CT date set, MSE, MAE, SNR, and the running time are applied to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. The average values of these evaluation indicators are 1.7322, 7.9010, 57.1241, and 5.4887, respectively. Compared with other three methods, these values indicate that the proposed method achieves better result. The experimental results prove that the proposed algorithm can effectively detect the weak edge of the lesion, which is helpful for the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

Because chitinase 3-like-1 (CHI3L1) is induced during aging and CM, the relationships between CHI3L1 and SC2 were investigated. Here, we demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of the SC2 receptor angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and viral spike protein priming proteases (SPP), that ACE2 and SPP are induced during aging, and that anti-CHI3L1, kasugamycin, and inhibitors of phosphorylation abrogate these ACE2- and SPP-inductive events. Human studies also demonstrate that the levels of circulating CHI3L1 are increased in the elderly and patients with CM, where they correlate with COVID-19 severity. These studies demonstrate that CHI3L1 is a potent stimulator of ACE2 and SPP, that this induction is a major mechanism contributing to the effects of aging during SC2 infection, and that CHI3L1 co-opts the CHI3L1 axis to augment SC2 infection. CHI3L1 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of and is an attractive therapeutic target in COVID-19.",

Due to its heterogeneous and variable characteristics, standardized assays for assessment of its biological activities are a challenge. The current set of studies were aimed to investigate the immune activity of bovine colostrum blends as well as develop a method to assess variability across different lots.METHODS: Immune activity of a bovine colostrum blend was evaluated by their ability to enhance PBMC (peripheral blood mononuclear cell)-mediated killing of K562 cells. K562 cell killing was assessed by flow cytometry using DAPI. PBMCs derived from multiple healthy donors were initially investigated. Frozen PBMC aliquots from one of the highest responders were used for subsequent studies. Different doses and lots of product were assessed. Incubation time was also explored.RESULTS: Bovine colostrum blend similarly reduced K562 cells number and these effects were often greater than the IL-2 positive control. Despite consistent efficacy at enhancing PBMCs-mediated K562 killing, the degree of the effect was significantly variable across different lots. These biological effects were largely dependent on the solubility of the product.CONCLUSION: Assessment of PBMC-mediated killing of K562 cells by flow cytometry using DAPI can be a reliable method for measuring immune activity of bovine colostrum when the material is well-dissolved into solution and the same biological sample from a single donor is used.",

Despite these circumstances, the number of nonsmoking eating and drinking establishments exceeded that of smoking establishments in March 2020 and continued to increase thereafter. Additionally, the number of nonsmoking \"restaurants\" increased and exceeded that of smoking restaurants in June 2020. The number of nonsmoking \"cafes\" already exceeded that of smoking \"cafes\" at the beginning of this survey and continued to increase. The number of nonsmoking \"bars\" increased, but that of smoking \"bars\" remained high.CONCLUSION: It is necessary to promote measures against passive smoking while paying attention to the trends for different types of eating and drinking establishments, rather than considering all establishments together.",

Methods: Scores on the World Health Organization Well-being Index and the Mental Health Inventory five-item versions, self-reported life satisfaction, happiness with self, body satisfaction, excellent self-rated health, and multiple health complaints of 9,077 schoolchildren (mean age: 13.99 � 1.91 years, percentage girls: 52.2%) were compared across modes of transport, unadjusted and adjusted for gender, age, family affluence and area of residence. Results: Those who reported using public transport reported poorer mental well-being than those using other means of transport, but adjusting for sociodemographic variables obscured these differences. The only exception was excellent health, where children who cycled outperformed the other three groups, even after adjustment for sociodemographic variables. Conclusions: Cycling can improve well-being in children.

FGDs were video-recorded, transcribed in Spanish, translated into English, and subjected to thematic analysis. Results: Pack groupings did not differ greatly across FGDs; bold, contrasting colors and elements communicating flavor and promotion increased cigarette pack appeal and desire to try. Participants perceived packs with these features to be used by and designed for youth, like themselves.

We compared HRQoL for three HL groups using ANOVA and the Kruskal-Wallis test. Results: Patients with low HL reported worse HRQoL than patients with moderate and high HL. The greatest differences between HL groups were found in the scales Effect of kidney disease, Cognitive function, Quality of social interaction, Social support, Dialysis staff encouragement, Patient satisfaction, Physical functioning, Pain, Emotional well-being and Social function. p-values in all cases were <0.001. Conclusion: Patients with low HL have a worse HRQoL in several domains than patients with a higher HL.

Results: Most attributes proved to be significant. Two attributes dominated all others: Avoiding a mandatory tracing app, and providing sufficient intensive care capacities. Preventing a high long-term unemployment rate and avoiding the isolation of persons aged 70+, were relevant, though utilities were comparatively lower. We identified subgroups (elderly persons and persons with school children) with different utilities, which indicates specific attributes affecting them dissimilarly.

Logistic regression and decomposition analysis were used to analyze the risk of mental health disorders, measured with the Self-Reporting Questionnaire -20 (SRQ-20). Results: Individuals with lower socio-economic status are at a higher risk for mental health disorders. Forced displacement accounts for 31% of the measured mental health inequalities. Disparities in employment, education level, disability and conflict incidence between municipalities are other contributing factors. Women and people with disabilities are respectively 2.3 and 1.2 times more prone to present a mental health disorder.

Methods: Data were retrieved from a nationally representative cross-sectional study of the Danish population conducted with the health literacy questionnaire (HLS-EU-Q16) in 2016 and 2017. Socio-demographic characteristics were drawn from national registers. Odds ratio for the association between employment status and health literacy was estimated from logistic regression models, adjusted for socio-demographic characteristics. Probability weights were used to adjust for differences in responses. Results: Logistic regression analyses showed that receiving unemployment benefits, social assistance, employment and support allowance, retirement pension and sickness benefit were significantly associated with having inadequate health literacy compared to being employed in any industry. The highest odds ratio for inadequate health literacy was present for receiving unemployment benefit OR = 1.78 (95% CI: 1.23-2.56). Conclusion: Population groups not working and receiving economic public support have higher odds of inadequate health literacy competencies compared to those active in the labor force, considering age and socioeconomic factors. The result contributes to understanding health disparities in connection to occupational situation.",

Methods: A cross-sectional online questionnaire study was conducted between 19 March and April 5, 2020 in Hong Kong. HCWs from public hospitals and private dentists, and their family members participated. Results: A total of 747 HCWs and 245 family members participated. Higher perceived stress in HCWs was associated with more negative changes in family relationship (p = 0.025). The HCWs' perceived stress, however, was positively associated with family cohesion (p = 0.033) and stress levels of family members (p < 0.001). The level of HCWs' satisfaction toward the hospital policies in response to the COVID-19 outbreak was associated with lower levels of perceived stress and risk of themselves or their family members contracting COVID-19. HCWs' previous frontline experience of SARS was significantly associated with less perceived risk of themselves or their family members contracting COVID-19. Conclusion: Hospital policies addressing HCWs' needs, frontline experience of SARS, and family relationship influenced psychological wellbeing of HCWs during the COVID-19 outbreak.",

Using principal component analysis, we deduced five evidence-based composite indices of the regions. We applied the generalized estimating equation to determine associations between the regional indices and the individual level of smoking. Results: The increased Industrial index in the region is associated with the probability of smoking (odds ratio = 1.15; 95% confidence interval = 1.06-1.24). The other indices show associations with smoking only in separate gender and educational groups. Surprisingly, it was found that the Economic index has no associations with the probability of smoking. Conclusion: We evaluated the key associations of the territorial indices with the individual probability of smoking, as well as the mutual influence between the territorial indices and individual factors.",

This study tested the extrinsic and intrinsic hypotheses regarding the burnout of healthcare workers in China with the ERI model. Method: Job stress was assessed by Siegrist's ERI questionnaire, and burnout was evaluated by the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS). A total of 1,505 effective respondents were included in the final study. Multiple and hierarchical linear regression was used to analyze the association between components in the ERI model and burnout. Results: Emotional exhaustion and cynicism were positively correlated with ERI and overcommitment. Professional efficacy was positively related to ERI but not to overcommitment. ERI was the determining factor of emotional exhaustion and cynicism. Overcommitment moderated the relationship between ERI and emotional exhaustion and between ERI and cynicism. Conclusion: Changing workplace conditions and increasing personal resilience might alleviate burnout among hospital workers in China. The links between professional efficacy and stressful work environment need further exploration.",

Multinomial logistic regression was applied to analyze the predictors of multimorbidity among women. Results: Almost 30% of the women had any of the selected morbidity and 9% of them had two or more morbidities. Hypertension and overweight combination (3%) was the most prevalent among women. The risk of having two or more morbidities was predominantly high among women aged above 30�years, low educated women, women from the wealthier group, ever-married women and women who were consuming tobacco as compared to their counterparts. Conclusions: From the policy perspective, the identification of groups of women vulnerable to multimorbidity will help in the selection of programmatic focus and preventive public health intervention in adult phase to reduce the multimorbidity burden among women in old ages.",

Methods: Using French National Perinatal Surveys, we estimated proportions of smokers and the number of cigarettes smoked both just before pregnancy and during the 3rd trimester from 1972 to 2016. We used a Poisson model with robust variance to estimate prevalence ratios for smoking during pregnancy. Results: Proportions of mothers quitting smoking were relatively stable (46.0% in 1972 and 45.8% in 2016). The number of cigarettes smoked just before pregnancy and in the 3rd trimester decreased from 1995 onward. However, proportions of smokers remained high before (30.1%) and during the 3rd trimester in 2016 (16.2%). Smoking in the 3rd trimester was associated with a lower education level and lower income in both 2010 and 2016, whereas the association with age, country of birth and parity varied according to the survey year. Conclusion: Early targeted interventions are needed for smokers who plan to have a child and must take smokers' characteristics during pregnancy into account.",

Methods: Data were obtained from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents (CI5plus) database. The average annual percent change (AAPC) was conducted by joinpoint regression analysis, and the age, period and cohort effects were estimated by age-period-cohort (APC) analysis. Results: The age-standardized incidence rates (ASIRs) in LA were higher than Shanghai and Hong Kong. During 1988-2012, the ASIRs significantly decreased in white women in LA (AAPC = -0.6%, 95% CI: -0.9% to -0.4%) while increased in Shanghai (2.5%: 2.1%-2.9%) and Hong Kong (2.2%: 2.0%-2.5%). The APC analysis revealed significantly increased effects of age and period, and decreased effect of birth cohort. Conclusion: Although age and cohort effects were relatively strong, the period effect may be the key factor affecting trends of incidence, which may be caused by increasing exposures to carcinogens and risk factors. Therefore, more effective measures should be carried out promptly to protect high-risk populations such as elder women, to avoid exposures to risk factors of breast cancer.",

Methods: The study investigated population-based cross-sectional (2003-2007) and longitudinal surveys (follow-up 2007-2010) from the 10/66 Dementia Research Group project. Poisson regression and Cox regression analyses were conducted to analyse correlates of loneliness and its association with mortality. Results: The standardised prevalence of loneliness varied between 25.3 and 32.4% in Latin America and was 18.3% in India. China showed a low prevalence of loneliness (3.8%). In pooled meta-analyses, there was robust evidence to support an association between loneliness and mortality across Latin American countries (HR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.01-1.26, I2 = 10.1%) and China (HR = 1.58, 95% CI 1.03-2.41), but there were no associations in India. Conclusion: Our findings suggest potential cultural variances may exist in the concept of loneliness in older age. The effect of loneliness upon mortality is consistent across different cultural settings excluding India. Loneliness should therefore be considered as a potential dimension of public health among older populations.",

Similarly, each of reported family adversities (death of a parent, substance abuse problems of a parent, conflicts/physical fights, divorce) was associated with more frequent fighting among adolescents. The mediation effect of hopelessness was found in each association of family-related adversity with fighting.

Participants were asked what they think the person has, which persons and services are helpful and how effective different treatment options are. Differences between the three vignettes were tested with 95% confidence intervals and � 2-tests. Results: 55.3% of the respondents identified depression as the health problem in question. Participants who heard the vignette with moderate symptomatology recognized depression more often. Across groups, a general practitioner was named most frequently concerning helpful persons/services. Effectiveness of psychotherapy received high levels of approval, online therapy and books were less often rated as effective. There were only few significant differences between the three vignettes. Conclusions: This is the first study examining public depression literacy for different severity levels. Small differences between severity levels indicate a lack of knowledge, which may have adverse consequences for adherence to treatment, especially for mild depression.",

Methods: The current study adopted the repeated cross-sectional research and was participated by a cohort of Chinese HCWs who were assigned to work at the current disease resistance line. The between-group information about gender, profession, and location was collected in the demographic questionnaire. Risk perception questionnaire was adapted for COVID-19 to assess risk perception and the Chinese version of emotional self-rating scale (PANAS) was used to evaluate HCWs' negative emotions. Results: Findings revealed the risk perception and negative emotions of HCWs varied in different gender, profession, location, as well as different periods of COVID-19. Over the different periods, the predominated negative emotion expressed by HCWs varied, but negative emotion was consistently associated with risk perception and could be a significant indicator of risk perception. Conclusion: The significance of this research lies in its examination of risk perception and negative emotions of HCWs confronting the COVID-19 during two periods of the pandemic, which underscored the importance of monitoring the risk perception and negative emotions of HCWs to ensure safety and prevent the return of the pandemics.",

A secondary goal is to test the moderating role of location. Methods: A total of 791 young adults between the ages of 18 and 30, drawn from the Somali Youth longitudinal study and a Canada-based study of college students, participated in the study. We used multivariate linear regression to assess the association between scores on the Radical Intentions Scale (RIS) with demographic characteristics, anxiety, depression, social support, and discrimination. Results: In the full sample, discrimination, age, and gender were associated with RIS scores. When we examined moderation effects by location, RIS scores were associated with depression only in Montr?al, and with social support (negatively) and discrimination in Toronto. None of the variables were significant in Boston. Conclusion: These findings suggest that an understanding of risk and protective factors for support of VR may be context-dependent. Further research should take into consideration local/regional differences.",

Methods: Data from 12,330 participants of the International SCI community survey (InSCI) from 22 countries were analyzed. Structural (partnership status, living situation) and functional aspects of social relationships (belongingness, relationship satisfaction, problems with social interactions) were regressed on the SF-36 mental health index (MHI-5), stratified by countries and for the total sample using multilevel models. Results: Functional aspects of social relationships were consistently related to clinically relevant higher MHI-5 scores and lower risk of mental health disorders (MHI-5 >56). Structural social relationships were inconsistently associated with mental health in our sample. Conclusion: This study provides evidence that functional aspects of social relationships are important resources for mental health. Interventions to establish and maintain high quality relationships should be considered in public health interventions and rehabilitation programs to reduce long-term mental health problems in persons experiencing physical disabilities.",

In order to understand the popularity of energy drinks among adolescents, and to target interventions, it is important to identify the determinants underpinning consumption. Methods: The nationally representative data (cross-sectional) were drawn from the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children (HBSC) surveys, conducted in 2014 and 2018, each comprising 13- and 15-year-old Finnish adolescents (n = 7405). Results: Weekly energy drink consumption increased among Finnish adolescents between 2014 (18.2%) and 2018 (24.4%), especially among girls. In 2018, boys typically consumed more than girls, and 15-year-olds more than 13-year-olds. Moreover, in 2018, weekly energy drink consumption was more prevalent among 15-year-old adolescents with a non-academic educational aspiration (46.0%) than among adolescents with an academic aspiration (18.3%). Gender (boys more than girls), older age (only in 2018), less parental monitoring, lower school achievement, and a lower level of health literacy explained around 28% of the variance in weekly energy drink consumption in both years. Conclusion: According to the findings, interventions to decrease the energy drink consumption, should be targeted at all adolescents, but especially at those with fewer individual resources. The interventions should also pay attention to family-level factors.",

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey in rural areas in Anhui, China. The complete data were available from 699 LBC and 740 non-LBC. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine 1) whether LBC were more likely to develop Internet addiction, and 2) the association between parent-child communication and Internet addiction among LBC. Results: LBC had a higher likelihood to report Internet addiction when compared to non-LBC (OR = 2.03, 95%CI = 1.43-2.88, p < 0.001). Among LBC, parent-child communication (both mother-child and father-child) was protective factor for children's Internet addiction. The role of mother-child communication played well among male LBC. Conclusions: The lack of parental supervision may lead to Internet addiction. It is highly recommended for migrant parents to improve the quality of communication with their children.

Methods: This study was part of the MASHAD cohort study. In all participants BMI and FAT% were measured. BMI was used to categorize individuals as obese, overweight, and normal subjects. FAT% was used to categorize individuals into tertile: tertile 1 (low) < 27.5, tertile 2 (medium) 27.5-41, and tertile 3 (high) > 41. The level of nightly sleep duration was categorized into three groups: <6, 6-8 (reference group), and >8�h.

Methods: Cross-sectional data from two representative German population-based studies, SHIP-TREND (n = 3,731) and KORA-F4 (n = 2,870), were analyzed. Multivariable logistic regression models were applied to estimate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for the association between socioeconomic determinants and macrovascular disease (defined as self-reported myocardial infarction or stroke). Results: The study showed a higher odds of prevalent macrovascular disease in men with low and middle educational level compared to men with high education. Area deprivation and equivalent income were not related to myocardial infarction or stroke in any of the models. Conclusion: Educational level, but not income or area deprivation, is significantly related to the macrovascular disease in men. Effective prevention of macrovascular disease should therefore start with investing in individual education.",

Methods: Based on an electronic medical records database, we built one patient cohort each for January-June 2019 (control, 173,523 patients) and 2020 (179,086 patients). We used linear regression to model weekly consultation counts and blood pressure (BP) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) measurement counts per 100 patients and predicted non-shutdown values. Analyses were repeated for selected at-risk groups and different age groups. Results: During the shutdown, weekly consultation counts were lower than predicted by -17.2% (total population), -16.5% (patients with hypertension), -17.5% (diabetes), -17.6% (cardiovascular disease), -15.7% (patients aged <60 years), -20.4% (60-80 years), and -14.5% (>80 years). Weekly BP counts were reduced by -35.3% (total population) and -35.0% (hypertension), and HbA1c counts by -33.2% (total population) and -29.8% (diabetes). p-values <0.001 for all reported estimates.

We also build on past studies by exploring the relationship between confidence in global health organizations and vaccine hesitancy. Methods: We conducted an online survey in seventeen countries/territories across five world regions between May -June 2020. We assessed the relationship between COVID19 vaccine hesitancy, confidence in public health organizations, and trust in key experts and leaders. Results: Our findings strongly suggest that confidence in the World Health Organization combined with trust in domestic scientists and healthcare professionals is a strong driver of vaccine acceptance across multiple countries/territories. Conclusion: We find that hesitancy is widespread, and uptake would be insufficient to achieve herd immunity. There is widespread confidence in how public health organizations have responded to the current pandemic and this is related to vaccine acceptance.

Logistic regressions examined young adults' likelihood of participating in COVID-19 immunization programs. Results: Approximately half of respondents reported being unlikely to get vaccinated against COVID-19. Compared to males, females were more likely to oppose COVID-19 vaccination (p < 0.05). In multivariate models, Sri Lankan maternal background and higher socioeconomic status were associated with a greater likelihood of getting vaccinated against COVID-19 (p < 0.05). Respondents were more likely to report a willingness to get vaccinated against COVID-19 when they perceived 1) an effective government response (p < 0.05) and 2) their information sources to be objective (p < 0.05).

The main objective of this study was to examine cancer-related knowledge, awareness, self-efficacy, and perceptions of screening barriers among low-income, illiterate immigrant women in France following an 8-weeks cancer educational intervention. Methods: Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with 164 female participants in the Ain department of France between January 2019 and March 2020. Adopting the Health Belief Model as an intervention and analytic framework, salient themes were identified using qualitative thematic analysis. Results: Increased levels of perceived susceptibility to and perceived severity of cancer contributed to higher motivation to get screened. Barriers to screening included low French proficiency, shame surrounding illiteracy, and constant worries due to precarious living conditions. Perceived benefits (e.g., valuing one's health and health-promoting behaviors), cues to action from a trusted source, and greater self-efficacy (e.g., more autonomous in healthcare-seeking) outweighed perceived barriers, including cultural barriers. Conclusions: Implications include developing audience-responsive targeted cancer screening communication strategies and educational materials to increase screening rates and reduce cancer and cancer screening inequities.",

This study aims to explore the Chinese acceptance of a COVID-19 vaccine before it is made available, including its determinants. Methods: A cross-national online survey was conducted covering all 31 provinces of mainland China. The survey consists of the demographic variables, acceptance of a self-paid COVID-19 vaccine as the dependent variable, and the 3Cs factors (i.e., confidence, convenience, and complacency) as the independent variables. Results: Among the 1,532 participants, 57.9% accepted to get a self-paid COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccine acceptors were more likely to be concerned about the effectiveness of the vaccines, believe that they were at risk of COVID-19 infection, have a high perceived susceptibility of COVID-19, and trust in the health care system. Conclusion: Findings indicate that the critical task in the early stage of the COVID-19 vaccine development in China is to increase the tolerance to some intuitive concerns about the vaccines, put more emphasis on the communication of the saliency of the disease threats, and effectively translate people's trust in the government into vaccine acceptance.",

In 2013, Switzerland introduced reimbursement of CRC screening by mandatory health insurance for 50-69-years-olds, after they met their deductible. We hypothesized that the 2013 reimbursement policy increased testing rate. Methods: In claims data from a Swiss insurance, we determined yearly CRC testing rate among 50-75-year-olds (2012-2018) and the association with socio-demographic, insurance-, and health-related covariates with multivariate-adjusted logistic regression models. We tested for interaction of age (50-69/70-75) on testing rate over time. Results: Among insurees (2012:355'683; 2018:348'526), yearly CRC testing rate increased from 2012 to 2018 (overall: 8.1-9.9%; colonoscopy: 5.0-7.6%; FOBT: 3.1-2.3%). Odds ratio (OR) were higher for 70-75-year-olds (2012: 1.16, 95%CI 1.13-1.20; 2018: 1.05, 95%CI 1.02-1.08). Deductible interacted with changes in testing rate over time (p < 0.001). The increase in testing rate was proportionally higher among 50-69-years-olds than 70-75-year-olds over the years. Conclusions: CRC testing rate in Switzerland increased from 2012 to 2018, particularly among 50-69-years-olds, the target population of the 2013 law. Future studies should explore the effect of encouraging FOBT or waiving deductible.",

Methods: We apply probit and ordinal probit models to a sample of 3,803 adults aged 20 and above from the 2016/17 round of the Suriname Survey of Living Conditions. Results: Women, the elderly, and couples who are either married and/or living together are more likely to be obese or overweight. This is also true for individuals who have chronic illnesses. We also find that individuals who engage in a sport or in other forms of exercise, even if modest, have lower odds of being overweight or obese. Interestingly, our findings indicate that individuals who benefit from government social safety net programs are less likely to be associated with being overweight or obese. Conclusion: Obesity could become a serious public health issue if not addressed appropriately.

Although TB is curable, poor health infrastructure, long and grueling TB treatments have led to the spread of TB pandemic with alarmingly increasing multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB prevalence. Alternative host modulating therapies can be employed to improve TB drug efficacies or dampen the exaggerated inflammatory responses to improve lung function. Here, we investigated the adjunct therapy of natural immune-modulatory compound berberine in C57BL/6 mouse model of pulmonary TB. Berberine treatment did not affect Mtb growth in axenic cultures; however, it showed increased bacterial killing in primary murine bone marrow-derived macrophages and human monocyte-derived macrophages. Ad libitum berberine administration was beneficial to the host in combination with rifampicin and isoniazid. Berberine adjunctive treatment resulted in decreased lung pathology with no additive or synergistic effects on bacterial burdens in mice. Lung immune cell flow cytometry analysis showed that adjunctive berberine treatment decreased neutrophil, CD11b+ dendritic cell and recruited interstitial macrophage numbers. Late onset of adjunctive berberine treatment resulted in a similar phenotype with consistently reduced numbers of neutrophils both in lungs and the spleen. Together, our results suggest that berberine can be supplemented as an immunomodulatory agent depending on the disease stage and inflammatory status of the host.",

It has been proposed that oxygenation may be inhibited by extracellular deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the form of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). Dornase alfa (Pulmozyme, Genentech) is recombinant human deoxyribonuclease I that acts as a mucolytic by cleaving and degrading extracellular DNA. We performed a pilot study to evaluate the effects of dornase alfa in patients with ARDS secondary to COVID-19.Methods: We performed a pilot, non-randomized, case-controlled clinical trial of inhaled dornase for patients who developed ARDS secondary to COVID-19 pneumonia.Results: Improvement in arterial oxygen saturation to inhaled fraction of oxygen ratio (PaO2/FiO2) was noted in the treatment group compared to control at day 2 (95% CI, 2.96 to 95.66, P-value = 0.038), as well as in static lung compliance at days 3 through 5 (95% CI, 4.8 to 19.1 mL/cmH2O, 2.7 to 16.5 mL/cmH2O, and 5.3 to 19.2 mL/cmH2O, respectively). These effects were not sustained at 14 days. A reduction in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) myeloperoxidase-DNA (DNA : MPO) complexes (95% CI, -14.7 to -1.32, P-value = 0.01) was observed after therapy with dornase alfa.Conclusion: Treatment with dornase alfa was associated with improved oxygenation and decreased DNA : MPO complexes in BALF. The positive effects, however, were limited to the time of drug delivery. These data suggest that degradation of extracellular DNA associated with NETs or other structures by inhaled dornase alfa can be beneficial. We propose a more extensive clinical trial is warranted.Clinical Trial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier: NCT04402970.",

The mechanisms are not clear but differential immune responses, particularly the initial innate immune response, between sexes may be playing a role. The early innate immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 have not been studied because of the gap in timing between the patient becoming infected, showing symptoms, and getting the treatment. The primary objective of the present study was to compare the response of dendritic cells (DCs) and monocytes from males and females to SARS-CoV-2, 24 h after infection. To investigate this, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy young individuals were stimulated in vitro with the virus. Our results indicate that PBMCs from females upregulated the expression of HLA-DR and CD86 on pDCs and mDCs after stimulation with the virus, while the activation of these cells was not significant in males. Monocytes from females also displayed increased activation than males. In addition, females secreted significantly higher levels of IFN-� and IL-29 compared with males at 24 h. However, the situation was reversed at 1 week post stimulation and males displayed high levels of IFN-� production compared with females. Further investigations revealed that the secretion of CXCL-10, a chemokine associated with lung complications, was higher in males than females at 24 h. The PBMCs from females also displayed increased induction of CTLs. Altogether, our results suggest that decreased activation of pDCs, mDCs, and monocytes and the delayed and prolonged IFN-� secretion along with increased CXCL-10 secretion may be responsible for the increased morbidity and mortality of males to COVID-19.",

It is unclear whether this fibrosis is a consequence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection or a risk factor for severe disease progression. We observed increased fibrosis in the left ventricular myocardium of deceased COVID-19 patients, compared with matched controls. We also detected increased mRNA levels of soluble interleukin-1 receptor-like 1 (sIL1-RL1) and transforming growth factor �1 (TGF-�1) in the left ventricular myocardium of deceased COVID-19 patients. Biochemical analysis of blood sampled from patients admitted to the emergency department (ED) with COVID-19 revealed highly elevated levels of TGF-�1 mRNA in these patients compared to controls. Left ventricular strain measured by echocardiography as a marker of pre-existing cardiac fibrosis correlated strongly with blood TGF-�1 mRNA levels and predicted disease severity in COVID-19 patients. In the left ventricular myocardium and lungs of COVID-19 patients, we found increased neuropilin-1 (NRP-1) RNA levels, which correlated strongly with the prevalence of pulmonary SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid. Cardiac and pulmonary fibrosis may therefore predispose these patients to increased cellular viral entry in the lung, which may explain the worse clinical outcome observed in our cohort. Our study demonstrates that patients at risk of clinical deterioration can be identified early by echocardiographic strain analysis and quantification of blood TGF-�1 mRNA performed at the time of first medical contact.",

In our pursuit to establish a model for severe COVID-19, we inoculated young and adult male ferrets intranasally or intratracheally with SARS-CoV-2. Intranasal inoculation established an infection in all ferrets, with viral dissemination into the brain and gut. Upon intratracheal inoculation only adult ferrets became infected. However, neither inoculation route induced observable COVID-19 symptoms. Despite this, a persistent inflammation in the nasal turbinates was prominent in especially young ferrets and follicular hyperplasia in the bronchi developed 21 days post infection. These effects -if sustained- might resemble long-COVID. Respiratory and systemic cellular responses and antibody responses were induced only in animals with an established infection. We conclude that intranasally-infected ferrets resemble asymptomatic COVID-19 and possibly aspects of long-COVID. Combined with the increasing portfolio to measure adaptive immunity, ferrets are a relevant model for SARS-CoV-2 vaccine research.",

In this work, we aimed to understand the immunological dynamics of severe COVID-19 patients with different degrees of illness, and upon long-term recovery. We analyzed immune cellular subsets and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody isotypes of 66 COVID-19 patients admitted to the Hospital Cl?nico Universidad de Chile, which were categorized according to the WHO ten-point clinical progression score. These included 29 moderate patients (score 4-5) and 37 severe patients under either high flow oxygen nasal cannula (18 patients, score 6), or invasive mechanical ventilation (19 patients, score 7-9), plus 28 convalescent patients and 28 healthy controls. Furthermore, six severe patients that recovered from the disease were longitudinally followed over 300 days. Our data indicate that severe COVID-19 patients display increased frequencies of plasmablasts, activated T cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies compared to moderate and convalescent patients. Remarkably, within the severe COVID-19 group, patients rapidly progressing into invasive mechanical ventilation show higher frequencies of plasmablasts, monocytes, eosinophils, Th1 cells and SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG than patients under high flow oxygen nasal cannula. These findings demonstrate that severe COVID-19 patients progressing into invasive mechanical ventilation show a distinctive type of immunity. In addition, patients that recover from severe COVID-19 begin to regain normal proportions of immune cells 100 days after hospital discharge and maintain high levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG throughout the study, which is an indicative sign of immunological memory. Thus, this work can provide useful information to better understand the diverse outcomes of severe COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

The patient was tested positive for type-A influenza, however negative for SARS-CoV-2. Despite escalated invasive ventilation, refractory hypercapnia (paCO2: 22�kPa) with severe respiratory acidosis (pH: 6.9) and a rising norepinephrine rate occurred within a few hours. Due to a Horovitz-Index < 100, out-of-centre veno-venous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (vv-ECMO)-implantation was performed. A CT-scan done because of anisocoria revealed an extended dissection of the right vertebral artery. While the initial left ventricular function was normal, echocardiography revealed severe global hypokinesia. After angiographic exclusion of coronary artery stenoses, we geared up LV unloading by additional implantation of an Impella CP and expanded the vv-ECMO to a veno-venous-arterial ECMO (vva-ECMO). Clinically relevant bleeding from the punctured femoral arteries resulted in massive transfusion and was treated by vascular surgery later on. Under continued MCS, LVEF increased to approximately 40% 2�days after the initiation of ECMELLA. After weaning, the Impella CP was explanted at day 5 and the vva-ECMO was removed on day 9, respectively. The patient was discharged in an unaffected neurological condition to rehabilitation 25�days after the initial admission.CONCLUSIONS: This exceptional case exemplifies the importance of aggressive MCS in severe cardiogenic shock, which may be especially promising in younger patients with non-ischaemic cardiomyopathy and potentially reversible causes of cardiogenic shock. This case impressively demonstrates that especially young patients may achieve complete neurological restoration, even though the initial prognosis may appear unfavourable.",

The primary outcome was all-cause ICU mortality. Secondary outcomes studied were ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day-28, and incidence of acute kidney injury (AKI). Propensity score matching was used to adjust for confounders, and the primary outcome was compared using competing-risks survival analysis.RESULTS: Among 590 patients included in the study, 400 received routine care, and 190 received IVIG therapy in addition to routine care. One hundred eighteen pairs were created after propensity score matching with no statistically significant differences between the groups. Overall ICU mortality in the study population was 27.1%, and in the matched cohort, it was 25.8%. Mortality was higher among IVIG-treated patients (36.4% vs. 15.3%; sHR 3.5; 95% CI 1.98-6.19; P < 0.001). Ventilator-free days and ICU-free days at day-28 were lower (P < 0.001 for both), and incidence of AKI was significantly higher (85.6% vs. 67.8%; P = 0.001) in the IVIG group.CONCLUSION: IVIG therapy in mechanically ventilated patients with COVID-19 related moderate-to-severe ARDS was associated with higher ICU mortality. A randomized clinical trial is needed to confirm this observation further.",

Several protocols have been proposed for healed athletes but all of them have been formulated for the adult population. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the adequacy of Italian practical recommendations for return-to-paly, in order to exclude cardiorespiratory complications due to COVID-19 in children and adolescents.METHODS: Between April 2020 and January 2021 the Italian Sports Medical Federation formulated cardiorespiratory protocols to be applied to athletes recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection. The protocols take into account the severity of the infection. Protocols include lung function tests, cardiopulmonary exercise test, echocardiographic evaluation, blood chemistry tests.RESULTS: From September 2020 to February 2021, 45 children and adolescents (aged from 9 to 18 years; male = 26) with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were evaluated according to the protocols in force for adult. 55.5% of the subjects (N = 25) reported an asymptomatic infection; 44.5% reported a mild symptomatic infection. Results of lung function test have exceeded the limit of 80% of the theoretical value in all patients. The cardiorespiratory capacity of all patients was within normal limits (average value of maximal oxigen uptake 41 ml/kg/min). No arrhythmic events or reduction in the ejection fraction were highlighted.CONCLUSION: The data obtained showed that, in the pediatric population, mild coronavirus infection does not cause cardiorespiratory complications in the short and medium term. Return to play after Coronavirus infection seems to be safe but it will be necessary to continue with the data analysis in order to modulate and optimize the protocols especially in the pediatric field.",

E. ortleppi is a species (formerly genotype 5 of E. granulosus s.l.) with unique epidemic areas (tropical areas), transmission patterns (mainly cattle origin), and pathological characteristics (large and small hook lengths) compared to other species that cause CE. A 19-year-old female patient in an area with no history of echinococcosis in Guizhou Province, China, was diagnosed with E. ortleppi infection in 2019.�This study is to�understand the source of this human E. ortleppi infection.METHODS: We performed computer tomography (CT) scans, surgical operation, morphological sectioning, molecular diagnosis, phylogenetic analyses, and epidemiological investigation in Anshun City, Guizhou Province, China in 2019.RESULTS: The patient presented with intermittent distension and pain in the upper abdomen without other abnormal symptoms. Routine blood examination results were normal. However, abdominal CT revealed a fertile cyst with a diameter of approximately 8�cm, uniform density, and a clear boundary, but without an evident cyst wall in the right lobe of the liver. The cyst was fertile, and phylogenetic analyses revealed that the isolates represented a new E. ortleppi genus haplotype. A result of 10‒14�years incubation period with indigenous infection was considered available for the case through the epidemiological survey.CONCLUSIONS: CE due to E. ortleppi infection can be confused with other diseases causing liver cysts, resulting in misdiagnosis. A transmission chain of E. ortleppi may exist or existed in the past in the previously considered non-endemic areas of echinococcosis in southwestern China.",

Although no reliable evidence has been found, it is considered that combining chemotherapeutic drugs with Chinese herbs can significantly improves the cure rate and the clinical therapeutic effect.METHODS: Multi-drug resistant pulmonary tuberculosis (MDR-PTB, n = 258) patients with Qi-yin deficiency syndrome will be randomly assigned into a treatment group (n = 172) or control/placebo group (n = 86). The treatment group will receive the chemotherapeutic drugs combined with Chinese herbs granules (1 + 3 granules), while the control group will receive the chemotherapeutic drugs combined with Chinese herbs placebo (1 + 3 placebo granules). In addition, MDR-PTB (n = 312) patients with Yin deficiency lung heat syndrome will be randomly assigned to a treatment (n = 208) or control/placebo (n = 104) group. The treatment group will receive the chemotherapeutic regimen combined with Chinese herbs granules (2 + 4 granules), while the control group will receive the chemotherapeutic drugs and Chinese herbs placebo (2 + 4 placebo granules). The primary outcome is cure rate, the secondary outcomes included time to sputum culture conversion, lesion absorption rate and cavity closure rate. BACTEC� MGIT� automated mycobacterial detection system will be used to evaluate the M.tb infection and drug resistance. Chi-square test and Cox regression will be conducted with SAS 9.4 Statistical software to analyze the data.DISCUSSION: The treatment cycle for MDR-PTB using standardized modern medicine could cause lengthy substantial side effects. Chinese herbs have been used for many years to treat MDR-PTB, but are without high-quality evidence. Hence, it is unknown whether Chinese herbs enhances the clinical therapeutic effect of synthetic drugs for treating MDR-PTB. Therefore, this study will be conducted to evaluate the clinical therapeutic effect of combining Chinese herbs and chemotherapeutic drugs to treat MDR-PTB cases. It will assist in screening new therapeutic drugs and establishing treatment plan that aims to improve the clinical therapeutic effect for MDR-PTB patients.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (ChiCTR1900027720) on 24 November 2019 (prospective registered).",

Data produced by scRNAseq is technically complex and requires analytical workflows that are an active field of bioinformatics research, whereas a wealth of biological background knowledge is needed to guide the investigation. Thus, there is an increasing need to develop applications geared towards bench-scientists to help them abstract the technical challenges of the analysis so that they can focus on the science at play. It is also expected that such applications should support closer collaboration between bioinformaticians and bench-scientists by providing reproducible science tools. We present SCHNAPPs, a Graphical User Interface (GUI), designed to enable bench-scientists to autonomously explore and interpret scRNAseq data and associated annotations. The R/Shiny-based application allows following different steps of scRNAseq analysis workflows from Seurat or Scran packages: performing quality control on cells and genes, normalizing the expression matrix, integrating different samples, dimension reduction, clustering, and differential gene expression analysis. Visualization tools for exploring each step of the process include violin plots, 2D projections, Box-plots, alluvial plots, and histograms. An R-markdown report can be generated that tracks modifications and selected visualizations. The modular design of the tool allows it to easily integrate new visualizations and analyses by bioinformaticians. We illustrate the main features of the tool by applying it to the characterization of T cells in a scRNAseq and Cellular Indexing of Transcriptomes and Epitopes by Sequencing (CITE-Seq) experiment of two healthy individuals.",

AIM2 is expressed in the kidney, but its localization and function are not fully characterized. In normal human glomeruli, AIM2 localized to podocytes. In patients with glomerulonephritis, AIM2 expression increased in CD44+-activated parietal epithelial cells within glomerular crescents. To explore AIM2 effects in glomerular disease, studies in Aim2 -/- mice were performed. Aim2-/- glomeruli showed reduced expression of Wilm tumor gene-1 (WT1), WT1-driven podocyte genes, and increased proliferation in outgrowth assays. In a nephrotoxic serum (NTS)-induced glomerulonephritis model, Aim2-/- (B6) mice exhibited more severe glomerular crescent formation, tubular injury, inflammation, and proteinuria compared with wild-type controls. Inflammasome activation markers were absent in both Aim2 -/- and wild-type kidneys, despite an increased inflammatory transcriptomic signature in Aim2 -/- mice. Aim2 -/- mice also demonstrated dysregulated cellular proliferation and an increase in CD44+ parietal epithelial cells during glomerulonephritis. The augmented inflammation and epithelial cell proliferation in Aim2 -/- (B6) mice was not due to genetic background, as Aim2 -/- (B6.129) mice demonstrated a similar phenotype during NTS glomerulonephritis. The AIM2-like receptor (ALR) locus was necessary for the inflammatory glomerulonephritis phenotype observed in Aim2 -/- mice, as NTS-treated ALR -/- mice displayed equal levels of injury as wild-type controls. Podocyte outgrowth from ALR -/- glomeruli was still increased, however, confirming that the ALR locus is dispensable for AIM2 effects on epithelial cell proliferation. These results identify a noncanonical role for AIM2 in suppressing inflammation and epithelial cell proliferation during glomerulonephritis.",

Viruses modulate HIF-1� to support viral replication and the survival of infected cells, but it is unclear if this transcription factor also plays an important role in regulating antiviral immune responses. In this study, we found that short and long dsRNA differentially engage TLR3, inducing distinct levels of proinflammatory cytokine production (TNF-� and IL-6) in bone marrow-derived macrophages from C57BL/6 mice. These responses are associated with differential accumulation of HIF-1�, which augments NF-�B activation. Unlike TLR4 responses, increased HIF-1� following TLR3 engagement is not associated with significant alterations in glycolytic activity and was more pronounced in low glucose conditions. We also show that the mechanisms supporting HIF-1� stabilization may differ following stimulation with short versus long dsRNA and that pyruvate kinase M2 and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species play a central role in these processes. Collectively, this work suggests that HIF-1� may fine-tune proinflammatory cytokine production during early antiviral immune responses, particularly when there is limited glucose availability or under other conditions of stress. Our findings also suggest we may be able to regulate the magnitude of proinflammatory cytokine production during antiviral responses by targeting proteins or molecules that contribute to HIF-1� stabilization.",

Although the allele is uniquely enriched in European descent, the mechanism for the widespread selective sweep is not clear. In this study, we find the rs3184504*T allele had a strong association with reduced mortality in a human sepsis cohort. The rs3184504*T allele associates with a loss-of-function amino acid change (p.R262W) in the adaptor protein SH2B3, a likely causal variant. To better understand the role of SH2B3 in sepsis, we used mouse modeling and challenged SH2B3-deficient mice with a polymicrobial cecal-ligation puncture (CLP) procedure. We found SH2B3 deficiency improved survival and morbidity with less organ damage and earlier bacterial clearance compared with control mice. The peritoneal infiltrating cells exhibited augmented phagocytosis in Sh2b3 -/- mice with enriched recruitment of Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes despite equivalent or reduced chemokine expression. Rapid cycling of monocytes and progenitors occurred uniquely in the Sh2b3 -/- mice following CLP, suggesting augmented myelopoiesis. To model the hypomorphic autoimmune risk allele, we created a novel knockin mouse harboring a similar point mutation in the murine pleckstrin homology domain of SH2B3. At baseline, phenotypic changes suggested a hypomorphic allele. In the CLP model, homozygous knockin mice displayed improved mortality and morbidity compared with wild-type or heterozygous mice. Collectively, these data suggest that hypomorphic SH2B3 improves the sepsis response and that balancing selection likely contributed to the relative frequency of the autoimmune risk variant.",

Alternative strategies to fight infection are needed. �-Glucan, an immunomodulator derived from the fungal cell wall, provokes resistance to infection by inducing trained immunity, a phenomenon that persists for weeks to months. Given the durability of trained immunity, it is unclear which leukocyte populations sustain this effect. Macrophages have a life span that surpasses the duration of trained immunity. Thus, we sought to define the contribution of differentiated macrophages to trained immunity. Our results show that �-glucan protects mice from Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection by augmenting recruitment of innate leukocytes to the site of infection and facilitating local clearance of bacteria, an effect that persists for more than 7 d. Adoptive transfer of macrophages, trained using �-glucan, into naive mice conferred a comparable level of protection. Trained mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages assumed an antimicrobial phenotype characterized by enhanced phagocytosis and reactive oxygen species production in parallel with sustained enhancements in glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, increased mitochondrial mass, and membrane potential. �-Glucan induced broad transcriptomic changes in macrophages consistent with early activation of the inflammatory response, followed by sustained alterations in transcripts associated with metabolism, cellular differentiation, and antimicrobial function. Trained macrophages constitutively secreted CCL chemokines and robustly produced proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in response to LPS challenge. Induction of the trained phenotype was independent of the classic �-glucan receptors Dectin-1 and TLR-2. These findings provide evidence that �-glucan induces enhanced protection from infection by driving trained immunity in macrophages.",

We recently discovered an unexpected CD4+ and CD8��+ immune cell population in healthy and atherosclerotic mice by single-cell RNA sequencing. Transcriptomically, these cells resembled thymic DPs. Flow cytometry and three-dimensional whole-mount imaging confirmed DPs in thymus, mediastinal adipose tissue, and aortic adventitia, but nowhere else. Deep transcriptional profiling revealed differences between DP cells isolated from the three locations. All DPs were dependent on RAG2 expression and the presence of the thymus. Mediastinal adipose tissue DPs resided in close vicinity to invariant NKT cells, which they could activate in vitro. Thymus transplantation failed to reconstitute extrathymic DPs, and frequencies of extrathymic DPs were unaltered by pharmacologic inhibition of S1P1, suggesting that their migration may be locally confined. Our results define two new, transcriptionally distinct subsets of extrathymic DPs that may play a role in aortic vascular homeostasis.",

A reduction in seismic noise during the COVID-19 pandemic has been observed worldwide, as restrictions were imposed to control outbreaks of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this context, we studied the effect of changes in anthropogenic activities during COVID-19 on the seismic noise levels in the Tokyo metropolitan area, Japan, considering time of day, day of the week, and seasonal changes. The results showed the largest reduction in noise levels during the first state of emergency under most conditions. After the first state of emergency was lifted, the daytime noise reverted to previous levels immediately on weekdays and gradually on Sundays. This was likely because economic activities instantly resumed, while non-essential outings on Sundays were still mostly avoided. Furthermore, the daytime noise level on Sundays was strongly reduced regardless of changes on weekdays after the second state of emergency, which restricted activities mainly at night. Sunday noise levels gradually increased from the middle of the second state of emergency, suggesting a gradual reduction in public concern about COVID-19 following a decrease in the number of infections. Our findings demonstrate that seismic noise can be used to monitor social activities.",

Porcine respiratory coronavirus AR310 particles (105) were placed in direct contact with the fabric for 1 or 5�min. Following one minute of contact, zeta potential of the porcine coronavirus was significantly lowered indicating destabilization of its electrokinetic properties. Size-distribution plot showed appearance of aggregation of the virus. Testing of the cytopathic effects of the virus showed eradication of infectivity as quantitatively assessed by PI-calcein and MTT cell viability tests.

Early treatment of COVID-19-associated diarrhea could relieve symptoms and limit viral spread within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Diosmectite, an aluminomagnesium silicate adsorbent clay with antidiarrheal effects, is recommended in some COVID-19 management protocols. In rotavirus models, diosmectite prevents pathogenic effects by binding the virus and its enterotoxin. We tested the trapping and anti-inflammatory properties of diosmectite in a SARS-CoV-2 model. Trapping effects were tested in Caco-2 cells using spike protein receptor-binding domain (RBD) and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 preparations. Trapping was assessed by immunofluorescence, alone or in the presence of cells. The effect of diosmectite on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) activation and CXCL10 secretion induced by the spike protein RBD and heat-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 were analyzed by Western blot and ELISA, respectively. Diosmectite bound the spike protein RBD and SARS-CoV-2 preparation, and inhibited interaction of the spike protein RBD with ACE2 receptors on the Caco-2 cell surface. Diosmectite exposure also inhibited NF-kappaB activation and CXCL10 secretion. These data provide direct evidence that diosmectite can bind SARS-CoV-2 components and inhibit downstream inflammation, supporting a mechanistic rationale for consideration of diosmectite as a management option for COVID-19-associated diarrhea.",

Due to the rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 and its impact, it is paramount to find effective treatments against it. Human neutralizing antibodies are an effective method to fight viral infection. However, the recent discovery of new strains that substantially change the S-protein sequence has raised concern about vaccines and antibodies' effectiveness. Here, using molecular simulations, we investigated the binding mechanisms between the S-protein and several antibodies. Multiple mutations were included to understand the strategies for antibody escape in new variants. We found that the combination of mutations K417N, E484K, L452R, and T478K produced higher binding energy to ACE2 than the wild type, suggesting higher efficiency to enter host cells. The mutations' effect depends on the antibody class. While Class I enhances the binding avidity in the presence of N501Y mutation, class II antibodies showed a sharp decline in the binding affinity. Our simulations suggest that Class I antibodies will remain effective against the new strains. In contrast, Class II antibodies will have less affinity to the S-protein, potentially affecting these antibodies' efficiency.",

We propose a deep learning approach to predict future COVID-19 infection cases and deaths 1 to 4 weeks ahead at the fine granularity of US counties. The multi-variate Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network is trained on multiple time series samples at the same time, including a mobility series. Results show that adding mobility as a variable and using multiple samples to train the network improve predictive performance both in terms of bias and of variance of the forecasts. We also show that the predicted results have similar accuracy and spatial patterns with a standard ensemble model used as benchmark. The model is attractive in many respects, including the fine geographic granularity of predictions and great predictive performance several weeks ahead. Furthermore, data requirement and computational intensity are reduced by substituting a single model to multiple models folded in an ensemble model.",

A cluster analysis was used to group adopters separately from non-adopters of NPIs.

Of the 4498 respondents, 994 (22%) were clustered as non-adopters. Sociodemographic factors significantly associated with the non-adoption cluster were: (1) being male, (2) age 18-34�years, (3) Albertans, (4) lower education level and (5) higher conservative political leaning. Participants who expressed low concern for COVID-19 and distrust towards several institutions had greater odds of being non-adopters.

Furthermore, the contribution of noncardiac factors - such as pulmonary, gastrointestinal, and psychological - to post-PCI CP HCU is unclear. Accordingly, the objectives of this study were to describe long-term trajectories and identify predictors of post-PCI CP-related HCU in real-world patients undergoing PCI for any indication. This retrospective cohort study included patients receiving PCI for any indication from 2003 to 2017 through a single integrated health-care system. Post-PCI CP-related HCU tracked through electronic medical records included (1) office visits, (2) emergency department (ED) visits, and (3) hospital admissions with CP or angina as the primary diagnosis. The strongest predictors of CP-related HCU were identified from >100 candidate variables. Among 6386 patients followed an average of 6.7 years after PCI, 73% received PCI for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), 19% for stable angina, and 8% for other indications. Post-PCI CP-related HCU was common with 26%, 16%, and 5% of patients having ?1 office visits, ED visits, and hospital admissions for CP within 2 years of PCI. The following factors were significant predictors of all 3 CP outcomes: ACS presentation, documented CP >7 days prior to the index PCI, anxiety, depression, and syncope. In conclusion, CP-related HCU following PCI was common, especially within the first 2 years.

The prodrug is a nucleoside analog that interferes with viral replication by inhibiting viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The drug has also been shown to be a weak inhibitor of human mitochondrial RNA polymerase, leaving open the possibility of mitochondrial off-targets and toxicity. The investigation was designed to explore whether remdesivir causes mitochondrial toxicity, using both genomic and functional parameters in the assessment. Human-derived HepG2 liver cells were exposed for up to 48�h in culture to increasing concentrations of remdesivir. At sub-cytotoxic concentrations (<1��M), the drug failed to alter either the number of copies or the expression of the mitochondrial genome. mtDNA copy number was unaffected as was the relative rates of expression of mtDNA-encoded and nuclear encoded subunits of complexes I and IV of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Consistent with this is the observation that remdesivir was without effect on mitochondrial respiration, including basal respiration, proton leak, maximum uncoupled respiration, spare respiratory capacity or coupling efficiency. We conclude that although remdesivir has weak inhibitory activity towards mitochondrial RNA polymerase, mitochondria are not primary off-targets for the mechanism of cytotoxicity of the drug.",

To assemble large pedigrees, we introduce several formulas and tools including a likelihood for the degree separating two small pedigrees, a generalization of the fast DRUID point estimate of the degree separating two pedigrees, a method for detecting individuals who share background identity-by-descent (IBD) that does not reflect recent common ancestry, and a method for identifying the ancestral branches through which distant relatives are connected. Our method also takes several approaches that help to improve the accuracy and efficiency of pedigree inference. In particular, we incorporate age information directly into the likelihood rather than using ages only for consistency checks and we employ a heuristic branch-and-bound-like approach to more efficiently explore the space of possible pedigrees. Together, these approaches make it possible to construct large pedigrees that are challenging or intractable for current inference methods.",

Although severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibodies have been observed in the breastmilk, the functional quality of these antibodies remains unclear. Here, we apply systems serology to characterize SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in maternal serum and breastmilk to compare the functional characteristics of antibodies in these fluids. Distinct SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody responses are observed in the serum and breastmilk of lactating individuals previously infected with SARS-CoV-2, with a more dominant transfer of immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgM into breastmilk. Although IgGs are present in breastmilk, they are functionally attenuated. We observe preferential transfer of antibodies capable of eliciting neutrophil phagocytosis and neutralization compared to other functions, pointing to selective transfer of certain functional antibodies to breastmilk. These data highlight the preferential transfer of SARS-CoV-2-specific IgA and IgM to breastmilk, accompanied by select IgG subpopulations, positioned to create a non-pathologic but protective barrier against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).",

The primary function of this ubiquitination is thought to be for tagging damaged or misfolded proteins for degradation. Here, working in mammalian cultured cells, we found that different stresses elicited distinct ubiquitination patterns. For heat stress, ubiquitination targeted specific proteins associated with cellular activities that are down-regulated during stress, including nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation, as well as stress granule constituents. Ubiquitination was not required for the shutdown of these processes or for stress granule formation but was essential for the resumption of cellular activities and for stress granule disassembly. Thus, stress-induced ubiquitination primes the cell for recovery after heat stress.",

The composition and assembly of stress granules is well understood, but little is known about the mechanisms that govern disassembly. Impaired disassembly has been implicated in some diseases including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, and multisystem proteinopathy. Using cultured human cells, we found that stress granule disassembly was context-dependent: Specifically in the setting of heat shock, disassembly required ubiquitination of G3BP1, the central protein within the stress granule RNA-protein network. We found that ubiquitinated G3BP1 interacted with the endoplasmic reticulum–associated protein FAF2, which engaged the ubiquitin-dependent segregase p97/VCP (valosin-containing protein). Thus, targeting of G3BP1 weakened the stress granule–specific interaction network, resulting in granule disassembly.",

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) vaccination is now available for frontline UK HCWs; however, demographic/occupational associations with vaccine uptake in this cohort are unknown. We sought to establish these associations in a large UK hospital workforce.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted cross-sectional surveillance examining vaccine uptake amongst all staff at University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust. We examined proportions of vaccinated staff stratified by demographic factors, occupation, and previous COVID-19 test results (serology/PCR) and used logistic regression to identify predictors of vaccination status after adjustment for confounders. We included 19,044 HCWs; 12,278 (64.5%) had received SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Compared to White HCWs (70.9% vaccinated), a significantly smaller proportion of ethnic minority HCWs were vaccinated (South Asian, 58.5%; Black, 36.8%; p < 0.001 for both). After adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, deprivation, occupation, SARS-CoV-2 serology/PCR results, and COVID-19-related work absences, factors found to be negatively associated with vaccine uptake were younger age, female sex, increased deprivation, pregnancy, and belonging to any non-White ethnic group (Black: adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 0.30, 95% CI 0.26-0.34, p < 0.001; South Asian: aOR 0.67, 95% CI 0.62-0.72, p < 0.001). Those who had previously had confirmed COVID-19 (by PCR) were less likely to be vaccinated than those who had tested negative. Limitations include data being from a single centre, lack of data on staff vaccinated outside the hospital system, and that staff may have taken up vaccination following data extraction.CONCLUSIONS: Ethnic minority HCWs and those from more deprived areas as well as younger staff and female staff are less likely to take up SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. These findings have major implications for the delivery of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination programmes, in HCWs and the wider population, and should inform the national vaccination programme to prevent the disparities of the pandemic from widening.",

The risk of infection and optimal preventive strategies for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic remain poorly understood. Here we report the results of a cohort study that included pre- and asymptomatic healthcare workers. A weekly testing regime has been performed in this cohort since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic to identify infected healthcare workers. Based on these observations we have developed a mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission that integrates the sources of infection from inside and outside the hospital. The data were used to study how regular testing and a desynchronisation protocol are effective in preventing transmission of COVID-19 infection at work, and compared both strategies in terms of workforce availability and cost-effectiveness. We showed that case incidence among healthcare workers is higher than would be explained solely by community infection. Furthermore, while testing and desynchronisation protocols are both effective in preventing nosocomial transmission, regular testing maintains work productivity with implementation costs.",

Understanding the variation in self-reported COVID-19 protective behaviors is critical to developing public health messaging. The purpose of the study is to provide nationally representative estimates of five self-reported COVID-19 protective behaviors and correlates of such behaviors. In this cross-sectional survey study of US adults, surveys were administered via internet and telephone. Adults were surveyed from April 30-May 4, 2020, a time of peaking COVID-19 incidence within the US. Participants were recruited from the probability-based AmeriSpeak� national panel. Brief surveys were completed by 994 adults, with 73.0% of respondents reported mask wearing, 82.7% reported physical distancing, 75.1% reported crowd avoidance, 89.8% reported increased hand-washing, and 7.7% reported having prior COVID-19 testing. Multivariate analysis (p critical value .05) indicates that women were more likely to report protective behaviors than men, as were those over age 60. Respondents who self-identified as having low incomes, histories of criminal justice involvement, and Republican Party affiliation, were less likely to report four protective behaviors, though Republicans and individuals with criminal justice histories were more likely to report having received COVID-19 testing. The majority of Americans engaged in COVID-19 protective behaviors, with low-income Americans, those with histories of criminal justice involvement, and self-identified Republicans less likely to engage in these preventive behaviors. Culturally competent public health messaging and interventions might focus on these latter groups to prevent future infections. These findings will remain highly relevant even with vaccines widely available, given the complementarities between vaccines and protective behaviors, as well as the many challenges in delivering vaccines.",

The present study explored internet addiction and changes in sleep patterns among medical students during the pandemic and assessed the relationship between them.METHODS: A cross-sectional study was carried out in seven countries, the Dominican Republic, Egypt, Guyana, India, Mexico, Pakistan, and Sudan, using a convenience sampling technique, an online survey comprising demographic details, information regarding COVID-19, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and the Internet Addiction Test (IAT).RESULTS: In total, 2749 participants completed the questionnaire. Of the total, 67.6% scored above 30 in the IAT, suggesting the presence of an Internet addiction, and 73.5% scored equal and above 5 in the PSQI, suggesting poor sleep quality. Internet addiction was found to be significant predictors of poor sleep quality, causing 13.2% of the variance in poor sleep quality. Participants who reported COVID-19 related symptoms had disturbed sleep and higher internet addiction levels when compared with those who did not. Participants who reported a diagnosis of COVID-19 reported poor sleep quality. Those living with a COVID-19 diagnosed patient reported higher internet addiction and worse sleep quality compared with those who did not have any COVID-19 patients in their surroundings.CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that internet addiction and poor sleep quality are two issues that require addressing amongst medical students. Medical training institutions should do their best to minimize their negative impact, particularly during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

Based on the strength and speed with which governments imposed non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) when confronted with waves of infections we distinguish between countries pursuing an elimination strategy and countries following a suppression / mitigation strategy. For a sample of 44 countries fixed effect panel regression results show that NPI changes conducted by elimination strategy countries had a less severe effect on GDP growth than NPI changes in suppression / mitigation strategy countries: strategy matters. However, this result is sensitive to the countries identified as \"elimination countries\" and to the sample composition. Moreover, we find that exogenous country characteristics drive the choice of strategy. At the same time our results show that countries successfully applying the elimination strategy achieved better health outcomes than their peers without having to accept lower growth.",

More precisely, data from wave 8 (21-22 April 2020) and wave 16 (7-8 July 2020) were used (in wave 8: analytical sample with n = 976, average age was 47.0 years (SD: 15.3 years), ranging from 18 to 74 years, 51.8% female; in wave 16: analytical sample with n = 978, average age was 46.1 years (SD: 15.9 years), ranging from 18 to 74 years, 50.9% female). After a short introduction emphasizing considerable economic costs associated with the measures against the spread of the coronavirus, individuals were asked to rate the following statements (outcome measures), in each case from 1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree: \"These economic costs are currently reasonable in relation to the objective pursued\" (reasonableness of costs), \"These economic costs should be borne jointly by all citizens and depending on income\" (solidarity financing).RESULTS: In wave 8 (wave 16 in parentheses), the average rating for the attitude towards reasonableness of costs was 4.3, SD: 1.8 (wave 16, average: 4.2, SD: 1.8) and the average rating for the attitude towards solidarity financing was 3.7, SD: 1.9 (wave 16, average: 3.3, SD: 2.0). In wave 8, more positive attitudes towards the reasonableness of costs and solidarity financing were associated with being male, higher education, not being in a partnership/being unmarried, higher affect regarding COVID-19 and higher presumed severity with respect to COVID-19. Furthermore, more positive attitudes towards the reasonableness of costs were associated with having a migration background. More positive attitudes towards solidarity financing was associated with higher age groups. Mainly similar findings were observed in wave 16.DISCUSSION: Agreement with reasonableness of costs of preventative measures as well as solidarity financing was moderately high. Knowledge of these attitudes is important to ensure social cohesion during the fight against COVID-19.",

We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of the BioNTech-Pfizer (BNT162b2) vaccine to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection and severe outcomes in octo- and novo-generians in a German state setting.METHODS AND FINDINGS: A prospective observational study of 708,187 persons aged ?80 years living in Bavaria, Germany, was conducted between Jan 9 to Apr 11, 2021. We assessed the vaccine effectiveness (VE) for two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine with respect to SARS-CoV-2 infection and related hospitalisations and mortality. Additionally, differences in VE by age groups ?80 to ?89 years and ?90 years were studied. Analyses were adjusted by sex. By the end of follow-up, 63.8% of the Bavarian population ?80 years had received one dose, and 52.7% two doses, of the BNT162b2 vaccine. Two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine lowered the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infections and related outcomes, resulting in VE estimates of 68.3% (95% confidence interval (CI) 65.5%, 70.9%) for infection, 73.2% (95% CI 65.3%, 79.3%) for hospitalisation, and 85.1% (95% CI 80.0%, 89.0%) for mortality. Sex differences in the risk of COVID-19 outcomes observed among unvaccinated persons disappeared after two BNT162b2 vaccine doses. Overall, the BNT162b2 vaccine was equally effective in octo- and novo-genarians.CONCLUSIONS: Two doses of BioNTech-Pfizer's BNT162b2 vaccine is highly effective against COVID-19 outcomes in elderly persons.",

Physical therapy (PT) is recommended per the 2019 ACR /Arthritis Foundation Guideline for Treatment of OA of the Hand, Hip, and Knee. During COVID-19, access to healthcare has been altered in a variety of clinical settings, with the pandemic creating delays in healthcare, with an unknown impact on access to PT care for OA.OBJECTIVES: We sought to determine whether referrals to PT for OA were reduced in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic compared to 2019.METHODS: A retrospective analysis was done of 3586 PT referrals placed by the University of California, Davis for 206 OA ICD-10 codes from January to November 2019 and from January to November 2020. The numbers of PT referrals per month of each year were compared using both descriptive statistics and Poisson Regression analysis.RESULTS: A total of 1972 PT referrals for OA were placed from January to November 2019. Only 1614 referrals for OA were placed from January to November 2020, representing a significant decrease (p = 0.001). Month-by-month analysis of 2020 compared to 2019 revealed statistically significant drops in PT referrals for OA in April (p = 0.001), May (p = 0.001), and August (p = 0.001).CONCLUSIONS: These findings reveal a significant reduction in the number of referrals for PT for OA placed in 2020 during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic. These reductions were particularly evident in the months following state-mandated actions and closures. Factors associated with this outcome may include decreased access to primary care providers, perceptions of PT availability by health care providers, decreased mobility limiting access to both clinic and PT appointments, and/or willingness to engage in PT by patients during the pandemic.",

The participants responded to an online questionnaire that included questions on demographic characteristics; the Attitude, Subjective Norms, and Behavioral Intention of Nurses toward Mechanically Ventilated Patients (ASIMP) questionnaire; the Nursing Professional Identity Scale (NPIS); and the Compassion Fatigue-Short Scale (CF-Short Scale). ANOVA, Spearman correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression were performed to analyze the data.RESULTS: The mean total behavioral intention score was 179.46 (� 14.83) out of a total score of 189.00, which represented a high level of intention toward caring for patients on mechanical ventilation. Multiple linear regression revealed that subjective norms (� = 0.390, P<0.001), perceived behavioral control (� = 0.149, P<0.001), professional identity (� = 0.101, P = 0.009), and compassion fatigue (� = 0.088 P = 0.024) were significant predictors of nurses' behavioral intention.CONCLUSIONS: Most nurses have a positive behavioral intention to care for COVID-19 patients undergoing mechanical ventilation.

We enrolled patients who received their first dose of radiotherapy for breast cancer between January 28 and July 31, 2019 and between January 28, 2020, and July 31, 2020. We compared the radiotherapy interruption patterns in 2019 with those in 2020 to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on treatment interruption. Between January 28 and July 31, 2019, 287 patients with breast cancer received radiotherapy. Among them, 19 patients (6.6%) experienced treatment interruption; the reasons for treatment interruption were radiotherapy-related side effects (10 patients, 52.6%), other medical reasons (three patients, 15.8%), and personal reasons (six patients, 31.6%). Between January 28 and July 31, 2020, 279 patients with breast cancer received radiotherapy. Among them, 23 patients (8.2%) experienced treatment interruption; the reasons for treatment interruption were radiotherapy-related side effects (eight patients, 35%) and COVID-19 screening clinic-related reasons (six patients, 26.1%). Among the six patients with screening clinic-related causes of radiotherapy interruption, five had asymptomatic fever and one had mild cold-like symptoms. The duration of treatment interruption was longer in patients with screening clinic-related interruptions than in those with interruptions because of other causes (p = 0.019). Multivariate analysis showed that cancer stage and radiotherapy volume did not significantly affect treatment interruption. The radiotherapy of certain patients was suspended despite the lack of a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Precise and systematic criteria for the management of patients with suspected COVID-19 are needed, and the opinion of radiation oncologist in charge of the patient must also be considered.",

Since healthcare professionals (HCPs) and armed forces personnel (AFP) represent a high-risk category, they act as a suitable target population to investigate vaccine-related side effects, including headache, which has emerged as a common complaint.METHODS: We investigated the side-effects of COVID-19 vaccines among HCPs and AFP through a 38 closed-question international survey. The electronic link was distributed via e-mail or via Whatsapp to more than 500 contacts. Responses to the survey questions were analyzed with bivariate tests.RESULTS: A total of 375 complete surveys have been analyzed. More than 88% received an mRNA vaccine and 11% received AdV first dose. A second dose of mRNA vaccine was administered in 76% of individuals. No severe adverse effects were reported, whereas moderate reactions and those lasting more than 1 day were more common with AdV (P=0.002 and P=0.024 respectively). Headache was commonly reported regardless of the vaccine type, but less frequently, with shorter duration and lower severity that usually experienced by participants, without significant difference irrespective of vaccine type.CONCLUSIONS: Both mRNA and AdV COVID-19 vaccines were safe and well tolerated in a real-life subset of HCPs and AFP subjects.",

This conclusion was also independently reached by John Snow during the 1854 cholera outbreak in London. By using an epidemiological method, Snow found that the infection spread through a polluted water network. Snow identified a water pump as the source of the disease. After removing the infected handle of this pump, the cases of cholera rapidly began to decrease. A microscopic examination of the water showed organic impurities but no bacteria. This discovery was ignored during Snow's lifetime. In contrast, through microscopy during the autopsies of cholera victims, Pacini observed that the disruption of their intestinal mucosa was closely associated with millions of the bacteria that he called Vibrio cholerae. Via histological techniques, Pacini detected that intestinal mucosa reabsorption dysfunction was the cause of debilitating diarrhoea, vomiting, severe dehydration and death. Nevertheless, his discovery of Vibrio cholerae was ignored during Pacini's lifetime. A survey of Pacini's autographic manuscripts suggests that Pacini and Snow may have shared mutual knowledge within their respective seminal papers. This survey also facilitates, for the first time, the creation of maps that illustrate the worldwide distribution of Pacini's cholera papers from 1854 to 1881. The consistent neglect of Pacini's discovery remains a true enigma.",

Few large-scale epidemiological studies have investigated potential prognostic factors for morbidity and mortality in this patient group.Aim. To evaluate the risk factors for morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients with ILD and viral infection, as well as the clinical characteristics.Methodology. This retrospective cohort study included patients with ILD who were hospitalized for a viral infection in two tertiary academic hospitals in China, between 1 January 2013 and 31 December 2019. We analysed the prevalence of comorbidities, clinical characteristics, 30 day mortality rates, and prognostic risk factors.Results. A total of 282 patients were included; 195 and 87 were immunocompromised and immunocompetent, respectively. The most common underlying interstitial diseases were idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (42.9 %) and connective tissue disease (36.9 %). The 30 day mortality rate was 20.6 %. During the influenza season, an increase in influenza virus (IFV) (25.7 %), respiratory syncytial virus (14.9 %) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) (11.3 %) cases was observed in the immunocompromised group. The most frequently detected virus in the immunocompetent group was IFV (44.8 %), followed by respiratory syncytial virus (11.5 %), and human rhinovirus (9.2 %). During the non-influenza season, CMV (34.4 %) was the main virus detected in the immunocompromised group. The 30 day mortality rates of non-IFV patients were higher than those of IFV patients. Older age (>60 years), respiratory failure, persistent lymphocytopenia, invasive mechanical ventilation and non-IFV virus infection were significantly associated with increased 30 day mortality.Conclusion. Patients with ILD who develop viral infection have high rates of morbidity and mortality, which are associated with increased age (>60 years), respiratory failure, mechanical ventilation, persistent lymphocytopenia and non-IFV virus infection. These risk factors should be carefully considered when determining treatment strategies for this patient population.",

During locomotion, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans spontaneously cycles between forward runs, reversals, and turns with complex but predictable dynamics. Here, we provide insight into these dynamics by demonstrating how RIM interneurons, which are active during reversals, act in two modes to stabilize both forward runs and reversals. By systematically quantifying the roles of RIM outputs during spontaneous behavior, we show that RIM lengthens reversals when depolarized through glutamate and tyramine neurotransmitters and lengthens forward runs when hyperpolarized through its gap junctions. RIM is not merely silent upon hyperpolarization: RIM gap junctions actively reinforce a hyperpolarized state of the reversal circuit. Additionally, the combined outputs of chemical synapses and gap junctions from RIM regulate forward-to-reversal transitions. Our results indicate that multiple classes of RIM synapses create behavioral inertia during spontaneous locomotion.",

Here, we demonstrate a role for medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) neurons projecting to the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus (PVT; mPFC?PVT) in this process. We found that a history of aversive stimuli negatively biased behavioral responses to motivationally relevant cues in mice and that this negative bias was associated with hyperactivity in mPFC?PVT neurons during exposure to those cues. Furthermore, artificially mimicking this hyperactive response with selective optogenetic excitation of the same pathway recapitulated the negative behavioral bias induced by aversive stimuli, whereas optogenetic inactivation of mPFC?PVT neurons prevented the development of the negative bias. Together, our results highlight how information flow within the mPFC?PVT circuit is critical for making predictions about motivationally-relevant outcomes as a function of prior experience.",

We investigated the presence of autoantibodies in acute COVID-19 and the association with early laboratory findings.MATERIALS AND METHODS: We examined 50 sera (>18�years, 25 Female) from patients with acute COVID-19. ANAs (HEp-20-10 liver biochip), anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA, Europlus Granulocyte Mosaic 32) and anti-double stranded DNA were investigated with product of Euroimmune AG (Luebeck, Germany) by indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) method. Also, antibody against cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) was examined by a chemiluminisens assay (Euroimmun AG, Luebeck, Germany). Samples from 50 blood bank donors collected before the COVID-19 pandemic were used as controls.RESULTS: The IIF-ANA test was positive in 18% (N�=�9/50) of the patients. The median time of sample collection was 7�days (range: 1-28�days) after diagnosis. ANA was positive in only one (2%) control sample. Five (55.5%) patients were ANA positive with a strong titer (3+). There was no relationship between antibody titration and time of sample collection (p�=�0,55). Anti-CCP was detected in a nucleolar (3+) positive patient (2%). ANA was detected in 14.28% (N�=�1/7, rods-rings (�), p�=�0,78) of patients in the intensive care unit(ICU). Patients treated in the clinic have more and higher titers of ANA, mostly in nucleolar patterns, than ICU patients.CONCLUSIONS: The variety of antibodies detected in acute COVID-19 and the uncertainty of how long they persist can lead to confusion, especially in the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases for IIF-ANA testing in immunology laboratories. Improvements in cell lines and methods will facilitate the diagnostic process.",

The SECD-6-K was then used to collect data from 350 adults diagnosed with chronic diseases. Content, construct, convergent, discriminant, and criterion validity were all evaluated. Reliability was assessed using Cronbach's �. SPSS 25.0 and the data were analyzed using AMOS 26.0 software.RESULTS: The SECD-6-K consists of six items in two domains: disease management and health behavior. The results for construct, convergent, and discriminant validity were good. Exploratory factor analysis produced eigen values between 2.27 and 3.28, with factors total explained cumulative variance of 91.1%. Confirmatory factor analysis supported goodness of fit and reliability for the modified SECD-6-K model. The criterion validity also showed significant correlation with both the Patient Health Questionnaire and 12-item Short-Form Health Survey version 2. Finally, reliability was found to be excellent.CONCLUSION: This study identified the high reliability and validity of SECD-6-K. The SECD-6-K is an appropriate tool for determining Korean patients' self-efficacy in managing their chronic conditions. Therefore, this scale may be used in clinical settings as well as in educational and research settings.",

A total of 328 questionnaires were used for the analysis. Analysis was performed using SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 26.0 programs.RESULTS: The child's self-regulation (� = .42, p < .001) had the most significant influence on the interaction between mothers and preschool children, followed by the mother's parenting stress (� = -.23, p =.008), social support (� = .17, p < .001), and the child's active temperament (� = .15, p < .001). The child's gender, emotional temperament, social temperament, and mother's education level had indirect influences.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that interventions considering the child's temperament, mother's parenting stress, and social support are required to promote the interaction between preschool-age children and mothers.",

We highlight how expedient vaccine delivery to high-risk groups is critical in mitigating COVID-19 disease and mortality. In scenarios where the availability of vaccine is insufficient for high-risk groups to receive two doses, administration of a single dose of is optimal, even when vaccine efficacy after one dose is just 75% of the two doses.

Applying RT-qPCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) of sequential respiratory specimens, we identify several mutations in the viral genome late in infection. We demonstrate that a late viral isolate exhibiting genome mutations similar to those found in variants of concern first identified in UK, South Africa, and Brazil, can escape neutralization by COVID-19 antisera. Moreover, infection of susceptible mice with this patient's escape variant elicits protective immunity against re-infection with either the parental virus and the escape variant, as well as high neutralization titers against the alpha and beta SARS-CoV-2 variants, B.1.1.7 and B.1.351, demonstrating a considerable immune control against such variants of concern. Upon lowering immunosuppressive treatment, the patient generated spike-specific neutralizing antibodies and resolved the infection.

The study reports factors for�COVID-19 vaccine acceptance among: (1) already vaccinated; (2) unvaccinated but willing to accept a vaccine; and (3) unvaccinated and unwilling to vaccinate. More than 20% were unwilling to vaccinate, expressing concerns about vaccine efficacy and safety and questioning the disease's severity. Poverty, working outside of the home and conservative political views are predictors of unwillingness. Conversely, those who either personally tested positive for COVID-19, or had a family member who did so, were more likely to accept vaccination. Majorities of all respondents supported vaccination mandates for employees and university students. Respondents preferred to receive vaccines in their doctor?s office. Lower income and conservative ideology, but not race, were strongly associated with vaccine unwillingness. The predictive value of COVID-VAC was demonstrated.

Analysis of variance and McNemar's test were employed for data analysis. Three hundred and eighty-four responses were analyzed. The majority of participants lived in three areas: Taiwan, Japan, and North America. Overall, the participants reported a high level of engagement in protective behaviors. However, engagement levels varied according to several demographic variables.

Sera from 49 COVID-19 patients were analyzed by untargeted lipidomics. Patients were clustered according to: inflammation (C-reactive protein), hypoxia (Horowitz Index), coagulation state (D-dimer), kidney function (creatinine) and age. COVID-19 patients exhibited remarkable and distinctive dyslipidemia for each prognostic factor associated with reduced defense against oxidative stress. When patients were clustered by outcome (7�days), a peculiar lipidome signature was detected with an overall increase of 29 lipid species, including-among others-four ceramide and three sulfatide species, univocally related to this analysis. Considering the lipids that were affected by all the prognostic factors, we found one sphingomyelin related to inflammation and viral infection of the respiratory tract and two sphingomyelins, that are independently related to patients' age,�and they appear as candidate biomarkers to monitor disease progression and severity.

In France, testing policies are determined at a regional level, generating exogenous variation in testing rates between departments on each side of a region border. We compared all contiguous department pairs located on the opposite sides of a region border. The increase of one percentage point in the test rate is associated with a decrease of 0.0015 percentage point in the death rate, that is, for each additional 2000 tests, we could observe three fewer deaths.

In a series of studies about preference for public health leadership advice, we asked 1061 participants to choose between (5) strict advice that is medically optimal if adhered to but which is less likely to be broadly followed, and (2) relaxed advice, which is less medically effective but more likely to gain adherence-given varying infection expectancies.

The data highlights important connections between population density and mobility, public transportation use, race, and increased likelihood of transmission. We use a transportation model to highlight the effect of uncertainty about transmission on the commuters' choice of transportation means. Using multiple estimation techniques, we found strong evidence that public transit ridership in several US metro areas has been considerably impacted by COVID-19 and by the policy responses to the pandemic. Concerns about disease transmission had a negative effect on ridership, which is over and above the adverse effect from the observed reduction in employment. The COVID-19 effect is likely to reduce the demand for public transport in favor of lower density alternatives. This change relative to the status quo will have implications for fuel use, congestion, accident frequency, and air quality. More vulnerable communities might be disproportionally affected as a result. We point to the need for additional studies to further quantify these effects and to assist policy in planning for the post-COVID-19 transportation future.",

We utilized survey data to quantify people's abidance by the mask mandate order. Additionally, we implicitly addressed the extent to which people abide by the mask mandate order, which�may depend on some parameters such as population, income, and education level. Using different machine learning classification algorithms, we investigated how the decrease or increase in death ratio for the counties in the US West Coast correlates with the input parameters. The results showed that for the majority of counties, the mask mandate order decreased the death ratio, reflecting the effectiveness of such a preventive measure on the West Coast. Additionally, the changes in the death ratio demonstrated a noticeable correlation with the socio-economic condition of each county. Moreover, the results showed a promising classification accuracy score as high as 90%.",

We show with chromosome conformation capture and gene-expression analysis that the rs17713054-affected enhancer upregulates the interacting gene, leucine zipper transcription factor like 1 (LZTFL1). Selective spatial transcriptomic analysis of lung biopsies from patients with COVID-19 shows the presence of signals associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a viral response pathway that is regulated by LZTFL1. We conclude that pulmonary epithelial cells undergoing EMT, rather than immune cells, are likely responsible for the 3p21.31-associated risk. Since the 3p21.31 effect is conferred by a gain-of-function, LZTFL1 may represent a therapeutic target.",

We aimed to synthesize all available research on the potential impact of eye protection on transmission of SARS-CoV-2.METHODS: We searched PROSPERO, PubMed, Embase, The Cochrane Library for clinical trials and comparative observational studies in CENTRAL, and Europe PMC for pre-prints. We included studies that reported sufficient data to estimate the effect of any form of eye protection including face shields and variants, goggles, and glasses, on subsequent confirmed infection with SARS-CoV-2.RESULTS: We screened 898 articles and included 6 reports of 5 observational studies from 4 countries (USA, India, Columbia, and United Kingdom) that tested face shields, goggles, and wraparound eyewear on 7567 healthcare workers. The three before-and-after and one retrospective cohort studies showed statistically significant and substantial reductions in SARS-CoV-2 infections favouring eye protection with odds ratios ranging from 0.04 to 0.6, corresponding to relative risk reductions of 96% to 40%. These reductions were not explained by changes in the community rates. However, the one case-control study reported odds ratio favouring no eye protection (OR 1.7, 95% CI 0.99, 3.0). The high heterogeneity between studies precluded any meaningful meta-analysis. None of the studies adjusted for potential confounders such as other protective behaviours, thus increasing the risk of bias, and decreasing the certainty of evidence to very low.CONCLUSIONS: Current studies suggest that eye protection may play a role in prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in healthcare workers. However, robust comparative trials are needed to clearly determine effectiveness of eye protections and wearability issues in both healthcare and general populations.",

The aim of this study was to explore the incidence and outcomes of gynecologic sarcomas in a large national data registry and to compare them with reports from other countries.STUDY DESIGN: Records of gynecologic sarcomas diagnosed in Israel (1980-2014) were extracted from the National Cancer Registry and classified according to International Classification of Diseases for Oncology-3 and characterized according to anatomical site, morphology and demographics. Age-standardized incidence rates and 1, 3, 5 and 10-year relative survival rates were calculated for 3 time periods (1980-1994, 1995-2001 and 2005-2014) according to patient age, stage and years of diagnosis.RESULTS: During 1980-2014, 1271 new gynecologic sarcomas were diagnosed in Israel, with incidence slightly increasing in 1980-2004, to an age-standardized incidence rate of 13 per million women. The most common histologic diagnosis was leiomyosarcoma (48%) and the most common anatomical site was the uterus (89%). The age-standardized incidence rate for uterine sarcoma is higher in Israel (10.55 per million) than in England (7.4 per million) and Germany (5.8 per million) respectively. The 5-year overall survival was significantly poorer in patients >70-years, as compared to younger patients (p<0.001) and in those with leiomyosarcoma compared to endometrial stromal sarcoma (p<0.001). The survival rate of patients with leiomyosarcoma in Israel are comparable to survival rates reported by other studies, although substantially lower regarding endometrial stromal sarcoma.CONCLUSIONS: Uterine leiomyosarcoma was the most common gynecologic sarcoma found in the Israeli, European and American registries. Older patients and those with leiomyosarcoma have the worst prognoses. Histological and anatomical variations in Israel are comparable with global statistics, but the incidence in Israel seems higher than in Europe.",

This sub-analysis included only ELITE participants with an intact uterus, who were randomized to either daily oral micronized 17-beta-E2 1 mg/day with 4% vaginal micronized P4 gel 45 mg/day for 10 days each month or placebo.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Participants were evaluated at baseline and annually during a median follow-up of 4.8 years for endometrial thickness as determined by pelvic transvaginal ultrasound followed by an endometrial biopsy when indicated, and cervical cytology and cancer incidence.RESULTS: Over up to 80 months of follow-up, participants randomized to oral E2 plus vaginal P4 had progressive and statistically significant increases in endometrial thickness (p<0.001), underwent more endometrial biopsies and had a higher rate of endometrial hyperplasia on endometrial biopsy compared with the placebo group. Due to the close follow-up of participants in the trial protocol, these abnormal findings were effectively treated.CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that 10 days of vaginal P4 45 mg/day is insufficient to completely oppose the effect of oral E2 1 mg/day on the endometrium. Further studies are needed to test alternative doses or frequencies of administration of vaginal P4 for adequate endometrial protection from E2 therapy among postmenopausal women.

Surveys included the Greene Climacteric Scale (GCS) and demographic questions.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GCS score by domain and subdomain, corrected for age, race, menopause stage and menopausal hormone therapy (HT).RESULTS: Phoenix participants (N�=�104) were 51.2 years old (SD 6.45), Hispanic (54.4%), White (28.2%) or African American (8.7%), and uninsured (53.0%). Scottsdale participants (N�=�151) were 52.6 years old (SD 5.52), mostly White (94.7%) and insured (100%). Three percent of Phoenix women were on HT vs. 23.3% in Scottsdale (p�<�0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed higher total GCS scores in the Phoenix vs. Scottsdale cohort (39.13 vs 30.14, p�<�0.001), which was also seen in the psychological and somatic domains, as well as the anxiety and depression subdomains. No statistically significant differences were seen in the vasomotor or sexual dysfunction domains.CONCLUSION: In a group of women living in Arizona from distinct socioeconomic areas, significant differences were demonstrated in menopausal symptom bother specifically with higher psychological and somatic symptoms in women who were uninsured or experiencing homelessness independent of age, race, menopause stage and HT use. Future studies controlling for co-morbidities associated with lower socioeconomic status such as depression would provide further insight into this population of midlife women.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the current prevalence of antibodies to pathogens known to potentially influence reproduction in European bison. Serum samples from 183 bison, originating from different parts of Poland, were tested using commercial ELISA tests for antibodies to Chlamydia spp., Coxiella burnetti, Leptospira interrogans, Neospora caninum and Toxoplasma gondii; the findings were compared between captive and main free-ranging herds, and with regard to the influence of demographic factors such as age and sex. The prevalence of seropositivity was also checked with regard to location and the animal species sharing it.RESULTS: Chlamydia spp. antibodies were present in 48 out of 130 (36.9%) tested samples. Coxiella burnetii was found in one sample out of 178 (0.58%). N. caninum in 36 out of 172 (20.9%) and T. gondii in 23 out of 172 (13.4%). No sample was positive for leptospirosis. Neither sex nor age appeared to have a significant effect on the occurrence of antibodies to the identified species. The prevalence of Chlamydia spp. in the samples varied significantly according to location; however, similar frequency ranges were observed between free ranging and captive herds. In contrast, antibodies to N. caninum were more common in free-ranging herds than captive herds, with the highest frequency observed in the Bieszczady Mountains.CONCLUSIONS: Chlamydia spp., N. caninum and T. gondii might have a similar impact on the reproductive potential of European bison as they have on cattle. The high occurrence of antibodies to N. caninum in bison from the Bieszczady Mountains may be associated with the relatively high density of the wolf population in the area.",

LEK can contribute to various areas of ecology, including habitat management and conservation biology. It has been recently revealed that recreational fishers' ecological knowledge (FEK) can also provide valuable information about different organisms and habitats, while recreational fishers' ecological knowledge is understudied in many aspects and regions of the world.METHODS: We aimed to record Hungarian recreational FEK on plant species related to freshwater habitats. Our research was conducted in three regularly fished water bodies in Hungary, namely Lake Velence, Keleti Main Canal, and Lake L?t?k?pi, where a total of 72 interviews were conducted with recreational anglers. During interviews, 24 plant species occurring at freshwater habitats with common or sporadic distribution were shown to anglers as single species or in congeneric pairs. Miscellaneous plant-related knowledge of anglers was also collected.RESULTS: Anglers identified a total of 16 plant species. They used 45 botanical or folk names. An angler knew the name of 4.6 plants on average and recognized 7.4 other species without naming it. According to our detailed analysis, anglers were able to name or at least recognize those plant species which are somehow related to fishing activities, are salient, and/or common. Moreover, anglers at Lake Velence recognized less plant species; however, they also had less years of fishing experience compared to anglers of the other two locations.CONCLUSION: We found that recreational FEK exists even in the case of freshwater plants which are not the main focus of anglers. It is highly presumable that recreational fishers would be able to provide reliable ecologically related data for scientific research establishing future citizen science projects of nature conservation.",

The following features were retrieved and analyzed: age, gender, duration and type of accused symptoms, traumatic etiology, and the discharge diagnosis.RESULTS: 136, 133, and 154 PEED visits have been performed respectively in 2017, 2018, and 2019, while 29 patients presented in 2020. Therefore, the volume of PEED activity decreased by 79.4% (p < 0.0001). Demographical and clinical characteristics were comparable to those of the pre-COVID period. Despite the absolute reduction in the number of traumas, urgent conditions increased significantly from 30.7 to 50.7% (p = 0.024).CONCLUSIONS: PEED activity decreased consistently after the onset of the pandemic and it was mainly attended by those children whose conditions required prompt assistance, reducing the number of patients diagnosed with milder pathologies. At the end of the emergency, better use of PEED could avoid overcrowding and minimize waste, allowing resource optimization for the management of urgent cases.",

Nevertheless, population-based studies examining the consequences on children are lacking.METHODS: All ED visits from 2019 to 2020 in Veneto, Italy (4.9 million residents) were collected. Anonymized records of pediatric (?14 years) ED visits included patient characteristics, arrival mode, triage code, clinical presentation, and discharge mode. Year-on-year variation of the main ED visit characteristics, and descriptive trends throughout the study period have been examined.RESULTS: Overall, 425,875 ED presentations were collected, 279,481 in 2019, and 146,394 in 2020 (- 48%), with a peak (- 79%) in March-April (first pandemic wave), and a second peak (below - 60%) in November-December (second pandemic wave). Burn or trauma, and fever were the two most common clinical presentations. Visits for nonurgent conditions underwent the strongest reduction during both pandemic waves, while urgent conditions reduced less sharply. ED arrival by ambulance was more common in 2020 (4.5%) than 2019 (3.5%), with a higher proportion of red triage codes (0.5%, and 0.4% respectively), and hospitalizations following ED discharge (9.1%, and 5.9% respectively).CONCLUSION: Since the beginning of the�COVID-19 pandemic, pediatric ED presentations underwent a steeper reduction than that observed for adults. Lockdown and fear of contagion in hospital-based services�likely deterred parents from seeking medical support for their children. Given COVID-19 could become endemic, it is imperative that public health experts guarantee unhindered access to medical support for�urgent, and less urgent health conditions, while minimizing infectious disease risks, to prevent children from suffering direct and indirect consequences of the pandemic.",

        "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Epidemics of COVID-19 in student populations at universities were a key concern for the 2020-2021 school year. The University of California (UC) System developed a set of recommendations to reduce campus infection rates. SARS-CoV-2 test results are summarized for the ten UC campuses during the Fall 2020 term.METHODS: UC mitigation efforts included protocols for the arrival of students living on-campus students, non-pharmaceutical interventions, daily symptom monitoring, symptomatic testing, asymptomatic surveillance testing, isolation and quarantine protocols, student ambassador programs for health education, campus health and safety pledges, and lowered density of on-campus student housing. We used data from UC campuses, the UC Health-California Department of Public Health Data Modeling Consortium, and the U.S. Census to estimate the proportion of each campus' student populations that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and compared it to the fraction individuals aged 20-29 years who tested positive in their respective counties.RESULTS: SARS-CoV-2 cases in campus populations were generally low in September and October 2020, but increased in November and especially December, and were highest in early to mid-January 2021, mirroring case trajectories in their respective counties. Many students were infected during the Thanksgiving and winter holiday recesses and were detected as cases upon returning to campus. The proportion of students who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 during Fall 2020 ranged from 1.2% to 5.2% for students living on campus and was similar to students living off campus. For most UC campuses the proportion of students testing positive was lower than that for the 20-29-year-old population in which campuses were located.CONCLUSIONS: The layered mitigation approach used on UC campuses, informed by public health science and augmented perhaps by a more compliant population, likely minimized campus transmission and outbreaks and limited transmission to surrounding communities. University policies that include these mitigation efforts in Fall 2020 along with SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, may alleviate some local concerns about college students returning to communities and facilitate resumption of normal campus operations and in-person instruction.",

The expansion of pre-existing programs (most notably conditional cash transfers and non-contributory pensions) during the COVID-19 crisis was generally insufficient to compensate for the inability to work among the poorest segments of the population. When COVID-19 ad hoc programs are analyzed, the coverage and replacement rates of regular labor income among households in the first quintile of the country's labor income distribution increase substantially. Yet, these programs present substantial coverage challenges among families composed of fundamentally informal workers who are non-poor, but are at a high risk of poverty. These results highlight the limitations of the fragmented nature of social protection systems in the region.",

Although digital innovations can boost process efficacy and business productivity, employees do not necessarily accept the implied work changes. We therefore looked at the increased digitalization efforts during the COVID-19 lockdowns, during which employees were forced to drastically rethink work by heavily depending on technology for communication and almost all business tasks. This global setting allowed us to scrutinize disruptive work changes and how employees can cope with disruptive work adaptations. We also looked into the explorative skillset needed to adapt to these changes. To theorize about an explorative BPM acceptance model, eleven hypotheses were supported based on a solid theoretical foundation. We followed a quantitative research design using partial least squares for structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) at the university administration settings in two regions, including purposive sampling. Data analysis covered both a measurement model assessment and structural model assessment. Our findings reveal that employees' perceived work modalities, feeling creative and feeling flexible are more promising features than perceived influence and attitude related to explorative work and skill development. We also offer novel insights into explorative business process management (BPM) skills, and which skills are more productive in uncertain or dynamic working conditions. This research is a learning path for managers struggling with flexible or competitive business environments, and more specifically to facilitate employee willingness.",

Since then, there has been steady increase in the number of cases. However, the number of cases in Nigeria is low in comparison to cases reported by other countries with similar large populations, despite the poor health system prevailing in the country. This has been mainly attributed to the low testing capacity in Nigeria among other factors. Therefore, there is a need for innovative ways to increase the number of persons testing for COVID-19. The aim of the study was to pilot a nasopharyngeal swab self-sample collection model that would help increase COVID-19 testing while ensuring minimal person-to-person contact being experienced at the testing center. 216 participants took part in this study which was carried out at the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research between June and July 2020. Amongst the 216 participants, 174 tested negatives for both self-collected samples and samples collected by Professionals, 30 tested positive for both arms, with discrepancies occurring in 6 samples where the self-collected samples were positive while the ones collected by the professionals were negative. The same occurred in another set of 6 samples with the self-collected samples being negative and the professional-collected sample coming out positive, with a sensitivity of 83.3% and a specificity of 96.7%. The results of the interrater analysis are Kappa = 0.800 (95% CI, 0.690 to 0.910) which implies an outstanding agreement between the two COVID-19 sampling methods. Furthermore, since p< 0.001 Kappa (k) coefficient is statistically different from zero, our findings have shown that self-collected samples can be reliable in the diagnosis of COVID-19.",

The aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis are to summarize the current literature and report clinical outcomes on the use of famotidine for treatment of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.METHODS: Five databases were searched through February 12, 2021 to identify observational studies that reported on associations of famotidine use with outcomes in COVID-19. Meta-analysis was conducted for composite primary clinical outcome (e.g. rate of death, intubation, or intensive care unit admissions) and death separately, where either aggregate odds ratio (OR) or hazard ratio (HR) was calculated.RESULTS: Four studies, reporting on 46,435 total patients and 3,110 patients treated with famotidine, were included in this meta-analysis. There was no significant association between famotidine use and composite outcomes in patients with COVID-19: HR 0.63 (95% CI: 0.35, 1.16). Across the three studies that reported mortality separated from other endpoints, there was no association between famotidine use during hospitalization and risk of death-HR 0.67 (95% CI: 0.26, 1.73) and OR 0.79 (95% CI: 0.19, 3.34). Heterogeneity ranged from 83.69% to 88.07%.CONCLUSION: Based on the existing observational studies, famotidine use is not associated with a reduced risk of mortality or combined outcome of mortality, intubation, and/or intensive care services in hospitalized individuals with COVID-19, though heterogeneity was high, and point estimates suggested a possible protective effect for the composite outcome that may not have been observed due to lack of power. Further randomized controlled trials (RCTs) may help determine the efficacy and safety of famotidine as a treatment for COVID-19 patients in various care settings of the disease.",

The first vaccine dose induced protection from infection from the circulating alpha (B.1.1.7) variant over several weeks. In a substudy of 589 individuals, we show that this single dose induces severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) neutralizing antibody (NAb) responses and a sustained B and T�cell response to the spike protein. NAb levels were higher after the extended dosing interval (6-14�weeks) compared with the conventional 3- to 4-week regimen, accompanied by enrichment of CD4+ T�cells expressing interleukin-2 (IL-2). Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection amplified and accelerated the response. These data on dynamic cellular and humoral responses indicate that extension of the dosing interval is an effective immunogenic protocol.",

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to determine whether omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acid concentrations are causally related to schizophrenia.METHODS: We did a two-sample Mendelian randomisation study, using deidentified summary-level data that were publicly available. Exposure-outcome relationships were evaluated using the inverse variance weighted two-sample Mendelian randomisation method using results from genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of fatty acid concentrations and schizophrenia. GWAS results were available for European (fatty acids) and European and Asian (schizophrenia) ancestry samples. Overall age and gender information were not calculable from the summary-level GWAS results. Weighted median, weighted mode, and Mendelian randomisation Egger regression methods were used as sensitivity analyses. To address underlying mechanisms, further analyses were done using single instruments within the FADS gene cluster and ELOVL2 gene locus. FADS gene cluster and ELOVL2 gene causal effects on schizophrenia were calculated by dividing the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-schizophrenia effect estimate by the SNP-fatty acid effect estimate with standard errors derived using the first term from a delta method expansion for the ratio estimate. Multivariable Mendelian randomisation was used to estimate direct effects of omega-3 fatty acids on schizophrenia, independent of omega-6 fatty acids, lipoproteins (ie, HDL and LDL), and triglycerides.FINDINGS: Mendelian randomisation analyses indicated that long-chain omega-3 and long-chain omega-6 fatty acid concentrations were associated with a lower risk of schizophrenia (eg, inverse variance weighted odds ratio [OR] 0�83 [95% CI 0�75-0�92] for docosahexaenoic acid). By contrast, there was weak evidence that short-chain omega-3 and short-chain omega-6 fatty acids were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia (eg, inverse variance weighted OR 1�07 [95% CI 0�98-1�18] for �-linolenic acid). Effects were consistent across the sensitivity analyses and the FADS single-SNP analyses, suggesting that long-chain omega-3 and long-chain omega-6 fatty acid concentrations were associated with lower risk of schizophrenia (eg, OR 0�74 [95% CI 0�58-0�96] for docosahexaenoic acid) whereas short-chain omega-3 and short-chain omega-6 fatty acid concentrations were associated with an increased risk of schizophrenia (eg, OR 1�08 [95% CI 1�02-1�15] for �-linolenic acid). By contrast, estimates from the ELOVL2 single-SNP analyses were more imprecise and compatible with both risk-increasing and protective effects for each of the fatty acid measures. Multivariable Mendelian randomisation indicated that the protective effect of docosahexaenoic acid on schizophrenia persisted after conditioning on other lipids, although evidence was slightly weaker (multivariable inverse variance weighted OR 0�84 [95% CI 0�71-1�01]).INTERPRETATION: Our results are compatible with the protective effects of long-chain omega-3 and long-chain omega-6 fatty acids on schizophrenia, suggesting that people with schizophrenia might have difficulty converting short-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids to long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids. Further studies are required to determine whether long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid supplementation or diet enrichment might help prevent onset of schizophrenia.FUNDING: National Institute for Health Research Biomedical Research Centre at University Hospitals Bristol and Weston NHS Foundation Trust and the University of Bristol.",

Whilst an age-based vaccination approach prioritising older groups is being implemented worldwide, vaccine hesitancy is high amongst minority ethnic groups.METHODS AND FINDINGS: We conducted a systematic review and convergent synthesis to systematically examine perceptions of vaccinations amongst older adults from minority ethnic backgrounds. We included studies that reported on perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes towards vaccinations in older adults aged ?65 years from a minority ethnic background. We excluded studies of vaccinations in investigation or development, studies focused on specific medical conditions, studies where ethnic background or age group was unidentifiable, systematic reviews, editorials, and conference abstracts. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, Virtual Health Library, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, medRxiv, and PROSPERO databases from inception to 15 July 2021. Risk of bias for studies was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool. The quality of evidence of collective outcomes was estimated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation-Confidence in the Evidence from Reviews of Qualitative research (GRADE-CERQual) framework. A total of 28 eligible studies conducted between 1997 and 2020 were included in the final analysis (17 quantitative surveys, 8 focus group or interview studies, 2 mixed methods studies, and 1 case-control study). The majority were US studies in English or Spanish, except for 6 studies set in Hong Kong, 2 studies in Japan, 1 study in Brazil, and 1 multi-centre study (including China, Indonesia, Turkey, South Korea, Greece, UK, Brazil, and Nigeria). In total, 28,262 individuals with an estimated mean age of 69.8 years were included, 63.2% of whom were female. We summarised the common concepts and themes across studies and populations using a convergent synthesis analysis. Thirteen themes categorised as barriers or facilitators were identified and grouped into structural factors-healthcare provider and system related, patient related, and policy and operational-and were analysed by minority ethnic group. The main limitation of the study was the predominance of studies from the US and East Asia.CONCLUSIONS: In this systematic review, we found that factors influencing vaccination uptake involve healthcare provider and system, patient-related, and governance-level factors that are specific to the older ethnic minority community being served. The evidence included in this review is supported by high or moderate certainty and can be translated to practice and policy. A tailored, multi-level approach combining increased education, access, and culturally competent discussions with trusted healthcare professionals to address health beliefs can maximise the potential impact of widespread vaccination policies.",

Epidemiological studies have reported a drastic increase in mental health problems, such as depression and anxiety, increased loneliness and feelings of disconnectedness from others, while resilience levels have been negatively affected, indicating an urgent need for intervention. The current study is embedded within the larger CovSocial project which sought to evaluate longitudinal changes in vulnerability, resilience and social cohesion during the pandemic. The current second phase will investigate the efficacy of brief online mental training interventions in reducing mental health problems, and enhancing psychological resilience and social capacities. It further provides a unique opportunity for the prediction of intervention effects by individual biopsychosocial characteristics and preceding longitudinal change patterns during the pandemic in 2020/21.METHODS: We will examine the differential effects of a socio-emotional (including 'Affect Dyad') and a mindfulness-based (including 'Breathing Meditation') intervention, delivered through a web- and cellphone application. Participants will undergo 10 weeks of intervention, and will be compared to a retest control group. The effectiveness of the interventions will be evaluated in a community sample (N = 300), which is recruited from the original longitudinal CovSocial sample. The pre- to post-intervention changes, potential underlying mechanisms, and prediction thereof, will be assessed on a wide range of outcomes: levels of stress, loneliness, depression and anxiety, resilience, prosocial behavior, empathy, compassion, and the impact on neuroendocrine, immunological and epigenetic markers. The multi-method nature of the study will incorporate self-report questionnaires, behavioral tasks, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) approaches, and biological, hormonal and epigenetic markers assessed in saliva.DISCUSSION: Results will reveal the differential effectiveness of two brief online interventions in improving mental health outcomes, as well as enhancing social capacities and resilience. The present study will serve as a first step for future application of scalable, low-cost interventions at a broader level to reduce stress and loneliness, improve mental health and build resilience and social capacities in the face of global stressors.TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered on May 17, 2020 with the ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04889508 registration number (clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04889508).",

However, Ali-M3 has not been externally validated. Our aim was to evaluate the accuracy of Ali-M3 for detecting COVID-19 and discuss its clinical value. We evaluated the external validity of Ali-M3 using sequential Japanese sampling data. In this retrospective cohort study, COVID-19 infection probabilities for 617 symptomatic patients were determined using Ali-M3. In 11 Japanese tertiary care facilities, these patients underwent reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing. They also underwent chest CT to confirm a diagnosis of COVID-19. Of the 617 patients, 289 (46.8%) were RT-PCR-positive. The area under the curve (AUC) of Ali-M3 for predicting a COVID-19 diagnosis was 0.797 (95% confidence interval: 0.762‒0.833) and the goodness-of-fit was P = 0.156. With a cut-off probability of a diagnosis of COVID-19 by Ali-M3 set at 0.5, the sensitivity and specificity were 80.6% and 68.3%, respectively. A cut-off of 0.2 yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 89.2% and 43.2%, respectively. Among the 223 patients who required oxygen, the AUC was 0.825. Sensitivity at a cut-off of 0.5% and 0.2% was 88.7% and 97.9%, respectively. Although the sensitivity was lower when the days from symptom onset were fewer, the sensitivity increased for both cut-off values after 5 days. We evaluated Ali-M3 using external validation with symptomatic patient data from Japanese tertiary care facilities. As Ali-M3 showed sufficient sensitivity performance, despite a lower specificity performance, Ali-M3 could be useful in excluding a diagnosis of COVID-19.",

While the literature on psychological factors influencing health behaviors during the COVID-19 is flourishing, there is a lack of cross-national research focusing on multiple health behaviors. The present study overcomes this limitation and affords a validation of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a conceptual framework for explaining the adoption of handwashing and limitation of social contacts, two health behaviors that highly differ in their nature. Specifically, we compare TPB model on these two protective behaviors among people living in Belgium (N = 3744) and France (N = 1060) during the COVID-19 sanitary crisis. Data were collected from March 18 until April 19, 2020, which corresponds to the spring lockdown and the first peak of the pandemic in these countries. Results indicated that more positive attitudes, greater social norms, increased perceived control and higher intentions were related to higher adherence to handwashing and limitation of social contacts, for both Belgian and French residents. Ultimately, we argued that the TPB model tends to manifest similarly across countries in explaining health behaviors, when comparing handwashing and limitation of social contacts among individuals living in different national contexts.",

We show that small proline-rich protein 2A (SPRR2A) is an intestinal antibacterial protein that is phylogenetically unrelated to previously discovered mammalian AMPs. In this study, SPRR2A was expressed in Paneth cells and goblet cells and selectively killed Gram-positive bacteria by disrupting their membranes. SPRR2A shaped intestinal microbiota composition, restricted bacterial association with the intestinal surface, and protected against Listeria monocytogenes infection. SPRR2A differed from other intestinal AMPs in that it was induced by type 2 cytokines produced during helminth infection. Moreover, SPRR2A protected against helminth-induced bacterial invasion of intestinal tissue. Thus, SPRR2A is a distinctive AMP triggered by type 2 immunity that protects the intestinal barrier during helminth infection.",

TMEM2 regulates cell adhesion and metastasis as well as intercellular communication by degrading nonprotein components of the extracellular matrix. This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between TMEM2 expression levels and glioma subtypes or patient prognosis. Our findings revealed that TMEM2 expression was abnormally upregulated in high-grade glioma. Moreover, combining TMEM2, the status of isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and 1p19q, we subdivided molecular subtypes with significant differences in survival. Patients in the MT-codel-low subgroup had better prognosis than those in the WT-no-codel-high subgroup, who fared the worst. Additionally, correlation analysis of TMEM2 and immune cell infiltration indicated an altered tumor microenvironment (TME) and cell redistribution in the TMEM2 high-expression subtype. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analysis revealed that focal adhesion and PI3K-Akt signaling pathways were enriched in the TMEM2-expressing group. In conclusion, aberrant TMEM2 expression can be used as an independent prognostic marker for refining glioma molecular subtyping and accurate prognosis. These findings will improve rational decision making to provide individualized therapy for patients with glioma.",

Although the majority of STDs are diagnosed in the private sector, publicly funded STD clinics have an important role in providing comprehensive sexual health care services, including STD and HIV screening, for a broad range of patients. In certain cases, STD clinics often are the only source of sexual health care for patients, particularly among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM).PERIOD COVERED: 2010-2018.DESCRIPTION OF THE SYSTEM: The STD Surveillance Network (SSuN) is an ongoing sentinel surveillance system for monitoring clinical information among patients attending STD clinics. SSuN is a collaboration of competitively selected state and city health departments that conduct facility-based sentinel surveillance in STD clinics. Information routinely collected through the course of patient encounters is obtained for all patients seeking care in the participating STD clinics. This information includes demographic, behavioral, and clinical characteristics (e.g., STD and HIV tests performed and STD and HIV diagnoses). This report presents 2010-2018 SSuN data from 14 STD clinics in five cities (Baltimore, Maryland; New York City, New York; Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; San Francisco, California; and Seattle, Washington) to describe the patient populations seeking care in these STD clinics. Estimated numbers and percentages of patients receiving selected STD-related health services were calculated for each year by using an inverse variance weighted random-effects model, adjusting for heterogeneity among SSuN jurisdictions. Trends in receipt of selected STD-related health services were examined and included HIV screening after an acute STD diagnosis among persons not previously known to have HIV infection, annual chlamydia screening among adolescent and young females, and extragenital chlamydia and gonorrhea screening among MSM.RESULTS: During 2010-2018, the total number of annual visits made in the 14 participating STD clinics decreased 29.8% (from 145,728 to 102,275 visits), and the total number of unique patients examined in the clinics decreased 35.1% (from 94,281 to 61,172 patients). Decreases in the number of unique patients occurred both among men who have sex with women only (42.4%; from 37,842 in 2010 to 21,781 in 2018) and among females (51.4%; from 36,485 in 2010 to 17,721 in 2018). The decreases in the number of female patients were observed across all age groups, although they were more pronounced among females aged ?24 years (66.4%; from 17,721 in 2010 to 5,962 in 2018). In contrast, the number of patients identified as MSM increased 44.0% (from 12,859 in 2010 to 18,512 in 2018), with the greatest increase among MSM aged ?25 years (58.6%; from 9,918 in 2010 to 15,733 in 2018). Among visits during which an acute STD (defined as chlamydia, gonorrhea, or primary or secondary syphilis) was diagnosed, the percentage of visits during which an HIV test was performed within approximately 14 days of the STD diagnosis increased from 58.2% in 2010 to 70.2% in 2018. Among those patients tested, 1,672 HIV infections were identified, of which 84.0% were among MSM. Among females aged 15-24 years, the percentage screened for chlamydia in any calendar year increased from 88.6% in 2010 to 90.6% in 2018. However, because fewer females aged 15-24 years attended these clinics during the study period, the crude number of adolescent and young females tested for chlamydia decreased from 14,249 in 2010 to 4,507 in 2018. During 2010-2018, the percentage of females retested after their first positive chlamydia diagnosis during the same year ranged from 11.4% to 13.3%. During 2010-2018, the percentage of MSM tested for rectal chlamydia and rectal gonorrhea increased (from 54.7% to 57.8% and from 55.0% to 58.4%, respectively). During the same period, increases were noted in the percentage of MSM with diagnosed rectal chlamydia (from 15.5% in 2010 to 17.7% in 2018) and rectal gonorrhea (from 13.3% in 2010 to 17.1% in 2018). In contrast with pharyngeal chlamydia, pharyngeal gonorrhea screening was more common (from 69.5% in 2010 to 74.6% in 2018), and the percentage positive doubled during the study period (from 7.3% in 2010 to 14.8% in 2018). Pharyngeal chlamydia testing also increased (from 50.3% in 2010 to 72.9% in 2018), with concurrent decreases in positivity (from 4.2% in 2010 to 2.6% in 2018).INTERPRETATION: During 2010-2018, changes occurred in the demographic composition of patients attending STD clinics participating in SSuN. Understanding trends in the demographic profile of STD patients and services provided can help identify addressable gaps in STD control efforts and direct public health action. Overall, fewer females, especially those aged 15-24 years, accessed care in these STD clinics during the study period. Untreated STDs among adolescent and young females can have serious consequences, including pelvic inflammatory disease and infertility. Additional efforts to monitor where adolescent and young females seek care and to ensure they are receiving quality STD-related health services are needed, especially considering increases in reported cases of STDs among females. Increases in the number of MSM attending STD clinics present a unique opportunity to reach this population with STD and HIV prevention services. Although a large percentage of STD cases are diagnosed outside of STD clinics, publicly funded STD clinics are an important safety-net provider of STD-related health services and provide vital STD-related health services for patient populations at risk for the consequences of STDs and HIV infection.PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIONS: STD-related health services represent effective strategies for preventing STD and HIV transmission and acquisition or STD-related sequelae. Ensuring that all persons receive quality HIV and STD prevention and treatment services is vital for an effective public health approach to reducing STDs. STD clinics provide crucial safety-net services for preventing STD-related morbidity, including timely identification and treatment of curable STDs such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis. Increases in the numbers of MSM attending STD clinics participating in SSuN provide additional opportunities for linking patients to high-impact HIV preventive services (e.g., pre-exposure prophylaxis), and the clinics are positioned to facilitate initiation or resumption of treatment among persons living with HIV.",

The worm typically emerges through the skin on a lower limb of the host 1 year after infection, causing pain and disability (1). There is no vaccine or medicine to prevent or medicine to treat dracunculiasis; eradication relies on case containment* to prevent water contamination and other interventions to prevent infection: health education, water filtration, treatment of unsafe water with temephos (an organophosphate larvicide), and provision of safe drinking water (1,2). The eradication campaign began in 1980 at CDC (1). In 1986, with an estimated 3.5 million cases† occurring annually in 20 African and Asian countries� (3), the World Health Assembly called for dracunculiasis elimination (4). The Guinea Worm Eradication Program (GWEP), led by The Carter Center and supported by the World Health Organization (WHO), UNICEF, CDC, and other partners, began assisting ministries of health in countries with endemic disease. With 27 cases in humans reported in 2020, five during January-June 2021, and only six countries currently affected by dracunculiasis (Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, South Sudan, and importations into Cameroon), achievement of eradication appears to be close. However, dracunculiasis eradication is challenged by civil unrest, insecurity, and epidemiologic and zoologic concerns. Guinea worm infections in dogs were first reported in Chad in 2012. Animal infections have now overtaken human cases, with 1,601 reported animal infections in 2020 and 443 during January-June 2021. Currently, all national GWEPs remain fully operational, with precautions taken to ensure safety of program staff and community members in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of COVID-19, The Carter Center convened the 2020 and 2021 annual GWEP Program Managers meetings virtually, and WHO's International Commission for the Certification of Dracunculiasis Eradication met virtually in October 2020. Since 1986, WHO has certified 199 countries, areas, and territories dracunculiasis-free. Six countries are still affected: five with endemic disease and importations into Cameroon. Seven countries (five with endemic dracunculiasis, Democratic Republic of the Congo, and Sudan) still lack certification (4). The existence of infected dogs, especially in Chad, and impeded access because of civil unrest and insecurity in Mali and South Sudan are now the greatest challenges to interrupting transmission. This report describes progress during January 2020-June 2021 and updates previous reports (2,4,5).",

In August 2021, FDA amended the EUAs for the two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines to allow for an additional primary dose in certain immunocompromised recipients of an initial mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series (1). During September-October 2021, FDA amended the EUAs to allow for a COVID-19 vaccine booster dose following a primary mRNA COVID-19 vaccination series in certain recipients aged ?18 years who are at increased risk for serious complications of COVID-19 or exposure to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), as well as in recipients aged ?18 years of Janssen COVID-19 vaccine (1) (Table). For the purposes of these recommendations, an additional primary (hereafter additional) dose refers to a dose of vaccine administered to persons who likely did not mount a protective immune response after initial vaccination. A booster dose refers to a dose of vaccine administered to enhance or restore protection by the primary vaccination, which might have waned over time. Health care professionals play a critical role in COVID-19 vaccination efforts, including for primary, additional, and booster vaccination, particularly to protect patients who are at increased risk for severe illness and death.",

After national AFM surveillance began in 2014, peaks in AFM cases were observed in the United States in 2014, 2016, and 2018 (1). On the basis of this biennial pattern, an increase in AFM was anticipated in 2020. To describe the epidemiology of confirmed AFM cases since 2018, demographic, clinical, and laboratory information collected as part of national AFM surveillance was reviewed. In 2018, a total of 238 confirmed AFM cases were reported to CDC, compared with 47 cases in 2019 and 32 in 2020. Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) was detected in specimens from 37 cases reported in 2018, one case in 2019 and none in 2020. Compared with 2018, cases reported during 2019-2020 occurred in older children and were less frequently associated with upper limb involvement, febrile or respiratory prodromal illness, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pleocytosis. These findings suggest that the etiologies of AFM in 2019 and 2020 differed from those in 2018. The absence of an increase in cases in 2020 reflects a deviation from the previously observed biennial pattern, and it is unclear when the next increase in AFM should be expected. Clinicians should continue to maintain vigilance and suspect AFM in any child with acute flaccid limb weakness, particularly in the setting of recent febrile or respiratory illness.",

Among COVID-19-like illness hospitalizations in persons whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90-179 days earlier, the odds of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 (adjusted for sociodemographic and health characteristics) among unvaccinated, previously infected adults were higher than the odds among fully vaccinated recipients of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine with no previous documented infection (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]�=�5.49; 95% confidence interval [CI]�=�2.75-10.99). These findings suggest that among hospitalized adults with COVID-19-like illness whose previous infection or vaccination occurred 90-179 days earlier, vaccine-induced immunity was more protective than infection-induced immunity against laboratory-confirmed COVID-19.

To evaluate vaccine effectiveness (VE) among immunocompromised adults, data from the VISION Network* on hospitalizations among persons aged ?18 years with COVID-19-like illness from 187 hospitals in nine states during January 17-September 5, 2021 were analyzed.

The frequent emergence of immune escape variants have spurred the search for prophylactic vaccines and therapeutic antibodies that confer broad protection against SARS-CoV-2 variants. Here we show that the bivalency of an affinity maturated fully human single-domain antibody (n3113.1-Fc) exhibits exquisite neutralizing potency against SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus, and confers effective prophylactic and therapeutic protection against authentic SARS-CoV-2 in the host cell receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) humanized mice. The crystal structure of n3113 in complex with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2, combined with the cryo-EM structures of n3113 and spike ecto-domain, reveals that n3113 binds to the side surface of up-state RBD with no competition with ACE2. The binding of n3113 to this novel epitope stabilizes spike in up-state conformations but inhibits SARS-CoV-2 S mediated membrane fusion, expanding our recognition of neutralization by antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Binding assay and pseudovirus neutralization assay show no evasion of recently prevalent SARS-CoV-2 lineages, including Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) for n3113.1-Fc with Y58L mutation, demonstrating the potential of n3113.1-Fc (Y58L) as a promising candidate for clinical development to treat COVID-19.",

Constrained peptide scaffolds were produced using modified enzymes gleaned from microbial RiPP (ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptide) pathways and diversified to build large libraries. The binding of a RiPP to a protein target leads to the intein-catalyzed release of an RNA polymerase � factor, which drives�the expression of selectable markers. As a proof-of-concept, a selection was performed for binding to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike receptor binding domain. A 1625 Da constrained peptide (AMK-1057) was found that binds with similar affinity (990 � 5 nM) as an ACE2-derived peptide. This demonstrates a generalizable method to identify constrained peptides that adhere to a single protein target, as a step towards \"molecular glues\" for therapeutics and diagnostics.",

How the host immune system senses and responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection remain largely unresolved. Here, we report that SARS-CoV-2 infection activates the innate immune response through the cytosolic DNA sensing cGAS-STING pathway. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces the cellular level of 2'3'-cGAMP associated with STING activation. cGAS recognizes chromatin DNA shuttled from the nucleus as a result of cell-to-cell fusion upon SARS-CoV-2 infection. We further demonstrate that the expression of spike protein from SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 from host cells is sufficient to trigger cytoplasmic chromatin upon cell fusion. Furthermore, cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway, but not MAVS-mediated viral RNA sensing pathway, contributes to interferon and pro-inflammatory gene expression upon cell fusion. Finally, we show that cGAS is required for host antiviral responses against SARS-CoV-2, and a STING-activating compound potently inhibits viral replication. Together, our study reported a previously unappreciated mechanism by which the host innate immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infection, mediated by cytoplasmic chromatin from the infected cells. Targeting the cytoplasmic chromatin-cGAS-STING pathway may offer novel therapeutic opportunities in treating COVID-19. In addition, these findings extend our knowledge in host defense against viral infection by showing that host cells' self-nucleic acids can be employed as a \"danger signal\" to alarm the immune system.",

To mitigate the impact of the coronavirus a reliable, fast, and accurate diagnostic system should be promptly implemented. In this study, we propose EpistoNet, a decision tree-based ensemble model using two mixtures of discriminative experts to classify COVID-19 lung infection from chest X-ray images. To optimize the architecture and hyper-parameters of the designed neural networks, we employed Epistocracy algorithm, a recently proposed hyper-heuristic evolutionary method. Using 2500 chest X-ray images consisting of 1250 COVID-19 and 1250 non-COVID-19 cases, we left out 500 images for testing and partitioned the remaining 2000 images into 5 different clusters using K-means clustering algorithm. We trained multiple deep convolutional neural networks on each cluster to help build a mixture of strong discriminative experts from the top-performing models supervised by a gating network. The final ensemble model obtained 95% accuracy on COVID-19 images and 93% accuracy on non-COVID-19. The experimental results show that EpistoNet can accurately, and reliably be used to detect COVID-19 infection in the chest X-ray images, and Epistocracy algorithm can be effectively used to optimize the hyper-parameters of the proposed models.",

Antibodies persisted up to 9�months after infection. Immune profiling of infected individuals revealed that with increasing severity of infection (asymptomatic, 1-3 symptoms, ? 4 symptoms, admitted to hospital/ICU), seroresponses were more robust and rich with a shift towards IgG over IgA and anti-spike over anti-nucleocapsid responses. Among seropositive participants, lower antibody levels were observed for those ? 60�years vs < 60�years old and smokers vs non-smokers. Overweight/obese participants vs normal weight had higher antibody levels. Adolescents (13-15�years old) (n = 260) showed a seroprevalence of 11.5%, were less likely to be tested seropositive compared to their parents and had dominant anti-spike rather than anti-nucleocapsid IgG responses.

Severe COVID-19 morbidity was defined based on the treatment histories of the intensive care unit, invasive ventilation, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and death. The susceptibility/morbidity/mortality associated with prior histories of 1-14, 1-30, 1-90, 15-45, 15-90, and 31-90�days before COVID-19 onset were analyzed using conditional/unconditional logistic regression.

Mobility restrictions and the requirement of a medical prescription for serological testing for COVID-19 were included among the control measures. Under this scenario, between April 15th and June 15th, 2020, we performed an observational study including 449 individuals allowed to be tested according to the governmental restrictions, i.e. fulfilling the following prescription requirements: manifestation of COVID-19-compatible symptoms, contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient, or employment as an essential worker, including health care workers, firefighters and public safety personnel such as police. Importantly, a relevant feature of the studied cohort was that none of the participants had been hospitalized. We analyzed SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity in this specific cohort, uncovering intrinsic features of great demographic interest. The overall rate of IgG seropositivity was 33.69% (95% CI: 29.27-38.21). This frequency was comparable among the different participant occupations. A RT-PCR positive test, contact with a household member previously tested positive and the presence of COVID-19-compatible symptoms were positively associated with IgG + results. Among these symptoms, ageusia/anosmia was positively and independently associated with SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity, while odynophagia was inversely associated. However, fever, ageusia/anosmia and asthenia were the most frequent symptoms described by IgG + subjects. Therefore, our data illustrate how specific cohorts display particular characteristics that should be taken into account when studying population-wide SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence and key defining symptoms of COVID-19.",

The US FDA has approved several therapeutics and vaccines worldwide through the emergency use authorization in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19. Nevertheless, the efficacies of these treatments are being challenged by viral escape mutations. There is an urgent need to develop effective treatments protecting against SARS-CoV-2 infection and to establish a stable effect-screening model to test potential drugs. Polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) have an intrinsic advantage in such developments because they can target rapidly mutating viral strains as a result of the complexity of their binding epitopes. In this study, we generated anti-receptor-binding domain (anti-RBD) pAbs from rabbit serum and tested their safety and efficacy in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection both in vivo and ex vivo. Primary human bronchial epithelial two-dimensional (2-D) organoids were cultured and differentiated to a mature morphology and subsequently employed for SARS-CoV-2 infection and drug screening. The pAbs protected the airway organoids from viral infection and tissue damage. Potential side effects were tested in mouse models for both inhalation and vein injection. The pAbs displayed effective viral neutralization effects without significant side effects. Thus, the use of animal immune serum-derived pAbs might be a potential therapy for protection against SARS-CoV-2 infection, with the strategy developed to produce these pAbs providing new insight into the treatment of respiratory tract infections, especially for infections with viruses undergoing rapid mutation.",

The total diversion of attention of government and health care workers (HCWs) to prevent the escalation of the pandemic disease has placed a great barrier to diagnosis and treatment of other illnesses that share common symptoms with COVID-19, and that has consequently enabled the endemic practice of self-antimicrobial medication to increase in Nigeria. Development of secondary infections in COVID-19 and in other conditions, caused by antibiotic resistant pathogens could make them more deadly now or in the future. The mitigation strategies adopted in Nigeria and its States, which include enforcing social distancing, partial or total lockdown, and restricting access to health care facilities for non COVID-19 patients, have further increased the demand of antimicrobial agents from unauthorized outlets in communities for inappropriate use. A cross-sectional survey of 162 randomly selected individuals that visited medical stores and 170 medical store owners to evaluates the level of self-medication with five oral broad spectrum antibiotics and antimalaria during the lockdown revealed an increase (68.5%) in practice of self-medication with at least one of the antimicrobial and emergence of new abusers. Blind treatment of symptoms of malaria and common cold without diagnosis and health care consultation was nearly 100%. Irrational use of sanitizers, disinfectants and other cidal agents that can fuel antimicrobial resistance has drastically increased in communities. Exposure of microorganisms in the environment without caution to large volume of fumigants is increasing on daily basis.

Disease activity index, functional index and quality of life index enabled disease monitoring.Conclusion: our results show that there was predominance in women. Patients were mostly affected by axial spondyloarthritis. More than half of our patients were treated with anti-inflammatory, 47% with methotrexate and 0.92% with biotherapy. This study highlights that the features of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) are a burden to the patient with spondyloarthritis and disease progression over time.",

Short IPI is associated with poor maternal and neonatal outcomes. We aimed to determine the factors associated with short IPI among women attending antenatal clinic (ANC) at Mnazi Mmoja Hospital, Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.Methods: a cross-sectional study was conducted in September 2018 at Mnazi Mmoja hospital among women receiving ante-natal care. A total of 530 women were included in the analysis. Analysis was conducted through SPSS version 24 computer program using descriptive analyses to determine the IPI and characteristics thereof, and logistic regression analysis to examine factors associated with IPI among pregnant women. Associations with a p-value < 0.05 were considered statistically significant.Results: twenty-two percent of the women attending ANC in Mnazi Mmoja hospital had short IPI. Short IPI was associated with young (<25years) age (AOR=2.67, 95% CI=1.23-5.79); non-use of a contraceptive method (AOR=2.05, 95%CI=1.22-3.45); breastfeeding for less than 6 months (AOR=3.45, 95% CI=1.17-10.13) and having an antecedent dead child at the time of index conception (AOR=3.38, 95% CI=1.15-9.93).Conclusion: about 1 in every 5 women attending ANC in Dar es Salaam had a short IPI. Addressing short IPI will complement the government?s efforts to improve maternal indicators in Tanzania and areas with similar contexts. Such efforts should emphasize in adherence to recommended infant feeding practices, women at a younger reproductive age group, those with a history of pregnancy loss, and strengthening contraception use among women of reproductive age.",

Socio-economic and clinical characteristics have been analysed. The bivariate and multivariate analyses have been used to demonstrate the association between the socio-demographic characteristics of the participants, the duration of the disease and the use of medicinal plants.Results: 45% of participants used medicinal plants. The most commonly reported reason for using medicinal plants was cancer cure (22%). During this study, 32 plants were identified. The Honey was the most commonly used (25%), thyme was also consumed at 15%, fenugreek at 13% and garlic at 7%. According to the multivariate analysis, the residence is predictor of medicinal plant use, urban residents used medicinal plants more than rural patients with an OR: 3,098, IC, 95%: [1,183-8,113] and P = 0,021. Fifty patients reported the moderate efficacy of the use of medicinal plants, and 20% described some side effects such as abdominal pain in 34%.Conclusion: in order to avoid any interaction with oncological drugs and to improve their effectiveness, a great importance must be given to information, education and awareness sessions.",

Households were selected using simple random sampling methodology. Chi-squared tests and logistic regression analysis were used to assess statistical differences between comprehensive knowledge and categorical variables.Results: from a total of 1,012 participants, only 22.0% of the respondents had comprehensive knowledge about HIV. The overall HIV prevalence in these communities was 24.2% and the HIV prevalence in individuals with comprehensive knowledge was 18.6%. Among the respondents with comprehensive knowledge, 33.1% were male, 22.0% have worked in a South African mine and the median age was 34 years old. Individuals from Muzingane were almost twice as likely (AOR 1.7; 95% IC 1.21-7.44, p=0.014) to have less comprehensive knowledge about HIV than their counterparts in Patrice Lumumba.Conclusion: the results demonstrate a low level of comprehensive knowledge about HIV amongst this population and reveal an association between comprehensive knowledge about HIV and prevalence.

We modified SORT-IT to create the Acute Care Operational Research (ACOR) course directed to anesthesiology residents in Kigali, Rwanda. This course takes students from an initial research idea through submitting a paper for publication. Our viewpoint on entering this study was that ACOR participants would have adequate resources to complete the course, but be hampered by cultural unfamiliarity with the blended teaching approach.Methods: we conducted a qualitative analysis of the experiences of all those who participated in the ACOR course to understand obstacles and improve future course iterations. Six anesthesiology residents participated in the first iteration of the course, with 4 local mentors and 2 secondary mentors, one of whom was based at the University of Virginia, with a total of 12 participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants and mentors, which were independently coded for topics by two reviewers.Results: there was a 50% publication rate for those enrolled in the course and an expected 100% acceptance rate for those who completed the course. Some reported benefits to the course included improved research knowledge, societal improvements, and knowledge exchange. Some reported obstacles to successful course completion included time limitations, background knowledge, and communication. Of note, only 4 out of 12 participants recognized cultural barriers.Conclusion: although successful in the sense that all participants completed their research project, ACOR did not fully solve the main issues hindering research training. Our results show that research training in low-resource settings needs a continuing and formal focus on the factors that hinder participants? success: mentorship and time.",

Emerging reports from endemic regions however are showing increasing malaria susceptibility in this age group. This study set out to determine the prevalence, parasite density and predictive factors for malaria parasitaemia in ill young infants at the Wesley Guild Hospital (WGH), Ilesa, Nigeria.Methods: ill infants aged one to six months were consecutively recruited over an 11-month period in a hospital based cross-sectional study. History of illness, sociodemographic and perinatal history were obtained; clinical examination and results of venous blood for thick and thin film malaria parasite examinations were recorded and analyzed.Results: the mean (SD) age of the 350 infants was 3.4 (1.6) months with male: female (M: F) of 1.2: 1. The prevalence of malaria parasitaemia (all plasmodium falciparum) was 19.1% while parasite density ranged from 24.0 to 400,000 parasites/�l, median (IQR) 900 (250-4,588)/�l. Sixteen (4.6%) had heavy malaria parasitaemia (>5000/�l).

Data analysis was done with the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26. Comparison of the uptake of healthcare before and during the COVID-19 pandemic was performed using the Chi-square test.Results: findings revealed a significant difference between the uptake of health care prior and during the COVID-19 pandemic (�2= 92.77, p=0.000) as 253 respondents (65.7%) reported that the hospital recorded a low turn-out of patients during the pandemic and 184 (47.8%) indicated that some of the facility units/departments were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 pandemic. Similarly, there was a significant difference between health-related conditions requiring hospital admission before and during COVID-19 pandemic (�2=3.334 p=0.046). Factors influencing uptake of health services during the COVID-19 pandemic are: fear of nosocomial infection, fear of stigmatization, and misconception/misinformation on COVID-19 diseases and care.Conclusion: the Nigerian health system in the past months has been remarkably impacted by the pandemic.

Purposeful sampling was used and data was collected using focus group discussions and in-depth interviews between August and September 2020. Analysis was done using qualitative content analysis.Results: twelve residents and six faculty members participated in this study. Two main themes emerged. The first was: \"New and unfamiliar teaching and learning experiences.\" Residents and faculty had to adapt to changes in the learning environment and the academic program. Residents had increased responsibilities, including providing front line care and working with reduced supervision. The second theme was: \"Learning opportunities amidst crisis.\" There were opportunities to improve critical care and procedural skills. They also had opportunities to improve non-technical skills like teamwork and communication.Conclusion: residents and faculty had to adapt to changes in teaching and learning. Residents also had to take up additional responsibilities. Support systems are required to help them adapt to the changes and settle in their new roles.

In multivariate analysis, the variables significantly associated with anti-HCV carriage were: be 60 years old and older (aOR: 46.9, 95% CI 10.2-216.0; p<0.0001) and a history of alcoholism (aOR: 6.3; 95% CI 95% 3.3-12.1; p < 0.0001).Conclusion: in the general population, the seroprevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was 1.5%. HCV infection mainly occurred in people aged 60 years and older and in those with a history of alcoholism.",

In emerging countries in Asia, the development of a program for older farmers to assess their risk of occupational falls is valuable. The current study aimed to evaluate the relationship between physical capacity and experience of occupational falls among middle-aged and older Thai farmers.METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 419�Thai farmers aged 40�years and over during March and April, 2021. For the assessment of physical capacity, we used the Self-Check Risk Assessment of Falls and Other Accidents in the Workplace tool developed in Japan, consisting of five physical test components. Multiple logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to analyze the data.RESULTS: The results revealed that 25.5% of participants had experienced occupational falls in the past 12�months. For each of the five physical test components, there was no significant association between physical capacity and experience of occupational falls. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was less than 0.60 for each of the five physical test components. A similar trend was observed when the analysis was limited to participants aged 50�years and over.CONCLUSIONS: The current study did not reveal any associations between physical capacity in each test and experience of occupational falls among middle-aged and older Thai farmers. Because the mechanisms underlying occupational falls are complex, multiple intervention approaches may be important for preventing accidents.",

A multivariate analysis identified only pN3 as an independent prognostic factor in CS patients. Among the differentiated tumor type patients, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) levels were significantly higher in pN3 patients than in pN0-2 patients before chemotherapy. Among undifferentiated tumor type patients, pN3 patients had a significantly lower tumor size ratio (before chemotherapy/before surgery) than pN0-2 patients.CONCLUSION: Although it is clinically difficult to diagnose lymph node metastasis using preoperative examinations, CA19-9 levels and tumor size ratios may be preoperative indicators for predicting pN3, which is associated with a poor prognosis in CS.",

Our prospective study evaluated post-operative immune response at baseline and postoperative day (POD) 1 and 2 after direct-to-implant pre-pectoral (PP) breast reconstruction with titanium-coated polypropylene mesh versus subpectoral (SP) breast reconstruction.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Between January and December 2020, 37 patients were randomized between PP (n=17) or SP (n=16) reconstruction. Baseline and operative data were analyzed. Postoperative pain assessment using numeric pain rating scale (NPRS), and a full blood count with lymphocyte subsets were collected before surgery, and on POD1 and POD2. Data were evaluated by two-way analysis of variance test.RESULTS: Baseline data did not demonstrate any statistical difference. Inter-group analysis did not provide any statistically significant difference in leukocytes, total lymphocytes, and lymphocytes subsets among SP and PP reconstruction groups (p>0.05). However, compared to specificity, the PP group experienced shorter operative time, with a mean difference 30.19 min, lower blood loss (p=0.017), lower rate of postoperative anemia (p=0.039), and a more favorable profile in inter-group pain analysis (p<0.001).CONCLUSION: PP reconstruction with titanium-coated polypropylene mesh does not increase immunological impairment in the early postoperative period when compared with SP reconstruction and provides lower postoperative pain, reduction of operative time, and lower rate of postoperative anemia.",

We investigated the difference in levothyroxine (LT4) supplementation and cessation between patients with benign disease and those with papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and found that the rate of LT4 cessation could be decreased after thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) suppression in PTC.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed 88 patients with benign tumor and 463 patients with PTC and investigated the risk factors for LT4 supplementation after thyroid lobectomy.RESULTS: During the median follow-up of 73.0 months, 207 (37.6%) patients maintained the euthyroid state, while 344 (62.4%) patients continued LT4 supplementation for LT4 replacement or TSH suppression. In patients with benign tumors, only high pre-TSH level (>1.98 mIU/l) was a significant risk factor (odds ratio [OR]=10.09). However, in patients with PTC, pre-TSH level ?1.98 mIU/l (OR=3.28), pregnancy planning (OR=2.97), and age ?42.5 years (OR=1.94) were significant risk factors. Moreover, the most potent risk factor was tumor aggressiveness (OR=4.00), which was found to be more significant than high pre-TSH. The overall rate of LT4 cessation in all patients was 37.6%; however, in the 303 patients who underwent the LT4-Off trial, there was no difference in the rate in the benign tumor, low-risk PTC, and intermediate-risk PTC groups (66.2%, 68.8%, and 70.8%, respectively; p=0.886).CONCLUSION: When post-lobectomy TSH levels were adequate and the risk of recurrence was reduced, LT4 cessation in PTC could be achieved at the same rate as that in benign tumors, regardless of the duration of TSH suppression.",

Here, we evaluated the safety and effectiveness of ASM.PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the surgical outcomes of 61 patients (64 breasts) who underwent ASM between 2016 and 2020.RESULTS: Of the 64 breasts, 33 (51.6%) underwent ASM because the tumour-NAC distance on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging was ?2 cm. Two patients had positive excisional margins but these were at the posterior areola surface therefore additional resection was possible. Over a median postoperative observation period of 16 months (range=3-52 months), one patient developed chest wall recurrence that was resected and did not recur again.CONCLUSION: For breast cancer with an extensive intraductal component, ASM is a good alternative to nipple-sparing mastectomy because it allows safe resection while maintaining aesthetics.",

Karnofsky performance status <80% and visceral metastasis were present in 18.2% and 46.4% of patients, respectively. SII was based on platelet ? neutrophil/lymphocyte counts. Study population was dichotomized by median into high and low SII groups before the initiation of chemotherapy and at week 6. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test.RESULTS: At median follow-up of 9.6 months, 174 patients experienced disease progression and 173 died. Patients with low SII at baseline and at week 6 had significantly better PFS (HR=0.58; p=0.0002 and HR=0.55; p<0.0001) and OS (HR=0.54; p<0.0001 and HR=0.54; p<0.0001) compared to patients with high SII.

N0 cases with venous or perineural invasion had survival curves similar to those of N1 patients. In addition, the number of invasive features (lymphatic, venous, or perineural) was an important factor in predicting poor patient survival.CONCLUSION: Venous and perineural invasion were significant prognostic factors in N0 gastric cancer cases.

In addition to conventional clinicopathological factors, we included the type of circular stapler using DST, conventional double-row circular stapler (DCS) or EEA� circular stapler with Tri-Staple� technology, 28 mm Medium/Thick (Covidien, New Haven, CT, USA) which had triple-row circular stapler (TCS) as a covariate. Auto-AI software Prediction One (Sony Network Communications Inc.) was used to predict AL with 5-fold cross validation. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Prediction One also evaluated the 'importance of variables' (IOV) using a method based on permutation feature importance.RESULTS: The area under the curve of the AI model was 0.766. The type of circular stapler used was the most influential factor contributing to AL (IOV=0.551).CONCLUSION: This auto-AI predictive model demonstrated an improvement in accuracy compared to the conventional model.

Mice with Vps33b-specific deletion in DCs, but not in macrophages or T cells, were more susceptible to Th2-mediated allergic lung inflammation than wild-type mice. Deletion of Vps33B in DCs led to enhanced CD4+ T cell proliferation and Th2 differentiation. Moreover, Vps33B specifically restrained reactive oxygen species production in conventional DC1s to inhibit Th2 responses in vitro, whereas Vps33B in monocyte-derived DCs and conventional DC2s was dispensable for Th2 development in asthma pathogenesis. Taken together, our results identify Vps33B as an important molecule that mediates the cross-talk between DCs and CD4+ T cells to further regulate allergic asthma pathogenesis.",

In lepirudin-anticoagulated human whole blood, we examined the effect of air bubbles on complement and its role in thromboinflammation. Whole blood from 16 donors was incubated with air bubbles without or with inhibitors of C3, C5, C5aR1, or CD14. Complement activation, hemostasis, and cytokine release were measured using ELISA and quantitative PCR. Compared with no air, incubating blood with air bubbles increased, on average, C3a 6.5-fold, C3bc 6-fold, C3bBbP 3.7-fold, C5a 4.6-fold, terminal complement complex sC5b9 3.6-fold, prothrombin fragments 1+2 (PTF1+2) 25-fold, tissue factor mRNA (TF-mRNA) 26-fold, microparticle tissue factor 6.1-fold, �-thromboglobulin 26-fold (all p < 0.05), and 25 cytokines 11-fold (range, 1.5-78-fold; all p < 0.0001). C3 inhibition attenuated complement and reduced PTF1+2 2-fold, TF-mRNA 5.4-fold, microparticle tissue factor 2-fold, and the 25 cytokines 2.7-fold (range, 1.4-4.9-fold; all p < 0.05). C5 inhibition reduced PTF1+2 2-fold and TF-mRNA 12-fold (all p < 0.05). C5 or CD14 inhibition alone reduced three cytokines, including IL-1� (p = 0.02 and p = 0.03). Combined C3 and CD14 inhibition reduced all cytokines 3.9-fold (range, 1.3-9.5-fold; p < 0.003) and was most pronounced for IL-1� (3.2- versus 6.4-fold), IL-6 (2.5- versus 9.3-fold), IL-8 (4.9- versus 8.6-fold), and IFN-� (5- versus 9.5-fold). Antifoam activated complement and was avoided. PTF1+2 was generated in whole blood but not in plasma. In summary, air bubbles activated complement and triggered a C3-driven thromboinflammation.

Integrins are the cell adhesion receptors that mediate leukocyte migration and functions. To date, it is not known whether integrin profiles correlate with their trafficking, differentiation, and polarization during sepsis. In this study, using endotoxemia and cecal ligation and puncture model of murine sepsis, we have analyzed the role of surface integrins in tissue-specific infiltration, distribution of monocytes and macrophages, and their association with inflammation-induced phenotypic and functional alterations postinduction (p.i.) of sepsis. Our data show that Ly-6Chi inflammatory monocytes infiltrated into the peritoneum from blood and bone marrow within a few hours p.i. of sepsis, with differential distribution of small (Ly-6CloCD11bloF4/80lo) and large peritoneal macrophages (Ly-6CloCD11bhiF4/80hi) in both models. The results from flow cytometry studies demonstrated a higher expression of integrin �4�1 on the Ly-6Chi monocytes in different tissues, whereas macrophages in the peritoneum and lungs expressed higher levels of integrin �5�1 and �v�3 in both models. Additionally, F4/80+ cells with CD206hiMHCIIlo phenotype increased in the lungs of both models by six hours p.i. and expressed higher levels of integrin �v�3 in both lungs and peritoneum. The presence of such cells correlated with higher levels of IL-10 and lower levels of IL-6 and IL-1� transcripts within six hours p.i. in the lungs compared with the mesentery. Furthermore, bioinformatic analysis with its experimental validation revealed an association of integrin �4 and �5 with inflammatory (e.g., p-SRC) and integrin �v with regulatory molecules (e.g., TGFBR1) in macrophages during sepsis.",

The regulation of STING in the activation of IFN expression has been extensively reported, whereas the regulation of STING in the initiation of autophagy is still insufficiently determined. IFN-inducible guanylate-binding proteins (GBPs) are central to the cell-autonomous immunity in defending a host against viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections. In this study using the Chinese tree shrew (Tupaia belangeri chinensis), which is genetically close to primates, we found that Tupaia GBP1 (tGBP1) combines with Tupaia STING (tSTING), promotes autophagy, and moderately inhibits HSV type 1 (HSV-1) infection. The antiviral effects of tGBP1 are IFN independent. Mechanistically, tGBP1 interacted with tSTING, Tupaia sequestosome 1, and Tupaia microtubule associated protein 1 L chain 3, forming a complex which promotes autophagy in response to HSV-1 infection. This function of tGBP1 against HSV-1 infection was lost in tSTING knockout cells. Overexpression of either tSTING or its mutant tSTING-�CTT that can only activate autophagy rescued the anti-HSV-1 activity of tGBP1 in tSTING knockout cells. Our study not only elucidated the underlying mechanism of tGBP1 antiviral activity against HSV-1 infection, but also uncovered the regulation of tSTING in the initiation of autophagy in response to HSV-1 infection.",

Although IgE-mediated degranulation is well researched, the cellular mechanisms of non-IgE-mediated mast cell activation are poorly understood despite the potential to induce similar pathophysiological effects. To better understand non-IgE mast cell degranulation, we characterized and compared cellular metabolic shifts across several mechanisms of degranulation (allergen-induced [IgE-mediated], 20 nm of silver nanoparticle-mediated [non-IgE], and compound 48/80-mediated [non-IgE]) in murine bone marrow-derived mast cells. All treatments differentially impacted mitochondrial activity and glucose uptake, suggesting diverging metabolic pathways between IgE- and non-IgE-mediated degranulation. Non-IgE treatments depleted mast cells' glycolytic reserve, and compound 48/80 further inhibited the ability to maximize mitochondrial respiration. This cellular reprogramming may be indicative of a stress response with non-IgE treatments. Neither of these outcomes occurred with IgE-mediated degranulation, hinting at a separate programmed response. Fuel flexibility between the three primary mitochondrial nutrient sources was also eliminated in activated cells and this was most significant in non-IgE-mediated degranulation. Lastly, metabolomics analysis of bone marrow-derived mast cells following degranulation was used to compare general metabolite profiles related to energetic pathways. IgE-mediated degranulation upregulated metabolite concentrations for the TCA cycle and glycolysis compared with other treatments. In conclusion, mast cell metabolism varies significantly between IgE- and non-IgE-mediated degranulation suggesting novel cell regulatory mechanisms are potentially driving unexplored pathways of mast cell degranulation.",

Here, we show that O-glycosylation near the furin cleavage site is mediated by members of the GALNT enzyme family, resulting in decreased furin cleavage and decreased syncytia formation. Moreover, we show that O-glycosylation is dependent on the novel proline at position 681 (P681). Mutations of P681 seen in the highly transmissible alpha and delta variants abrogate O-glycosylation, increase furin cleavage, and increase syncytia formation. Finally, we show that GALNT family members capable of glycosylating S are expressed in human respiratory cells that are targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results suggest that host O-glycosylation may influence viral infectivity/tropism by modulating furin cleavage of S and provide mechanistic insight into the role of the P681 mutations found in the highly transmissible alpha and delta variants.",

In the context of COVID-19 pandemic, the risk of co-infection and the burden it poses on healthcare system calls for timely influenza vaccination among pregnant women, who are the priority population recommended for vaccination. We aimed to evaluate the acceptance of influenza vaccination and associated factors among pregnant women during COVID-19 pandemic, provide evidence to improve influenza vaccination among pregnant women, help reduce the risk of infection and alleviate the burden of healthcare system for co-infected patients.METHODS: We conducted a multi-center cross-sectional study among pregnant women in China. Sociodemographic characteristics, health status, knowledge on influenza, attitude towards vaccination, and health beliefs were collected. Locally weighted scatterplot smoothing regression analysis was used to evaluate the trends in the acceptance of influenza vaccine. Logistic regression was applied to identify factors associated with vaccination acceptance.RESULTS: The total acceptance rate was 76.5% (95%CI: 74.8-78.1%) among 2568 pregnant women enrolled. Only 8.3% of the participants had a history of seasonal influenza vaccination. In the logistic regression model, factors associated with the acceptance of influenza vaccine were western region, history of influenza vaccination, high knowledge of influenza infection and vaccination, high level of perceived susceptibility, perceived benefit, cues to action and low level of perceived barriers. Among 23.5% of the participants who had vaccine hesitancy, 48.0% of them were worried about side effect, 35.6% of them lacked confidence of vaccine safety.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlighted that tailored strategies and publicity for influenza vaccination in the context of COVID-19 pandemic are warranted to reduce pregnant women's concerns, improve their knowledge, expand vaccine uptake and alleviate pressure for healthcare system.",

The lack or excess of circulating nutrients reaching the ovary can change its gene expression. A protein deficiency in the blood caused by an Haemonchus contortus abomasal infection is detrimental to the organism's development during puberty. The peripubertal period is a time of intensive growth that requires a high level of nutrients. An essential feature controlling pubertal arousal and female reproductive potential is ovarian follicle growth activation. Protein supplementation improves the sheep's immune response to helminthic infections. We aimed to determine if supplementing protein in infected ewe lambs' diet would impact the ovarian environment leading to earlier ovarian follicle activation than in infected not supplemented animals.METHODS: We fed 18 Santa Ines ewe lambs (Ovis aries) - bred by the same ram - with either 12% protein (Control groups) or 19% protein (Supplemented groups) in their diets. After 35 days of the diet, they were each artificially infected or not with 10,000 Haemonchus contortus L3 larvae. Following 77 days of the diet and 42 days of infection, we surgically collected their left ovaries and examined their genes expression through RNA sequencing.RESULTS: We found that protein supplementation in infected animals led to an up-regulation of genes (FDR p-values < 0.05) and biological processes (p-value cut-off = 0.01) linked to meiotic activation in pre-ovulatory follicles and primordial follicle activation, among others. The supplemented not infected animals also up-regulated genes and processes linked to meiosis and others, such as circadian behaviour. The not supplemented animals had these same processes down-regulated while up-regulated processes related to tissue morphogenesis, inflammation and immune response.CONCLUSION: Diet's protein supplementation of peripubertal infected animals allowed them to express genes related to a more mature ovarian follicle stage than their half-sisters that were not supplemented. These results could be modelling potential effects of the interaction between environmental factors, nutrition and infection on reproductive health. When ovarian activation is achieved in a timely fashion, the ewe may generate more lambs during its reproductive life, increasing sheep breeders' productivity.",

Border screening typically consists of travellers being thermally scanned for signs of fever and/or completing a survey declaring any possible symptoms prior to admission to their destination country; while more thorough testing typically exists, these would generally prove more disruptive to deploy. In this paper, we describe a simple Monte Carlo based model that incorporates the epidemiology of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) to investigate the potential decrease in risk of disease importation that might be achieved by requiring travellers to undergo screening upon arrival during the current pandemic. This is a purely theoretical study to investigate the maximum impact that might be attained by deploying a test or testing programme simply at the point of entry, through which we may assess such action in the real world as a method of decreasing the risk of importation. We, therefore, assume ideal conditions such as 100% compliance among travellers and the use of a 'perfect' test. In addition to COVID-19, we also apply the presented model to simulated outbreaks of influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Ebola for comparison. Our model only considers screening implemented at airports, being the predominant method of international travel. Primary results showed that in the best-case scenario, screening at the point of entry may detect a maximum of 8.8% of travellers infected with COVID-19, compared to 34.8.%, 9.7% and 3.0% for travellers infected with influenza, SARS and Ebola respectively. While results appear to indicate that screening is more effective at preventing disease ingress when the disease in question has a shorter average incubation period, our results suggest that screening at the point of entry alone does not represent a sufficient method to adequately protect a nation from the importation of COVID-19 cases.",

Excess years of life lost were estimated as the difference between the observed and expected years of life lost in 2020 using the World Health Organization standard life table.RESULTS: Reduction in life expectancy in men and women was observed in all the countries studied except New Zealand, Taiwan, and Norway, where there was a gain in life expectancy in 2020. No evidence was found of a change in life expectancy in Denmark, Iceland, and South Korea. The highest reduction in life expectancy was observed in Russia (men: -2.33, 95% confidence interval -2.50 to -2.17; women: -2.14, -2.25 to -2.03), the United States (men: -2.27, -2.39 to -2.15; women: -1.61, -1.70 to -1.51), Bulgaria (men: -1.96, -2.11 to -1.81; women: -1.37, -1.74 to -1.01), Lithuania (men: -1.83, -2.07 to -1.59; women: -1.21, -1.36 to -1.05), Chile (men: -1.64, -1.97 to -1.32; women: -0.88, -1.28 to -0.50), and Spain (men: -1.35, -1.53 to -1.18; women: -1.13, -1.37 to -0.90). Years of life lost in 2020 were higher than expected in all countries except Taiwan, New Zealand, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, and South Korea. In the remaining 31 countries, more than 222 million years of life were lost in 2020, which is 28.1 million (95% confidence interval 26.8m to 29.5m) years of life lost more than expected (17.3 million (16.8m to 17.8m) in men and 10.8 million (10.4m to 11.3m) in women). The highest excess years of life lost per 100 000 population were observed in Bulgaria (men: 7260, 95% confidence interval 6820 to 7710; women: 3730, 2740 to 4730), Russia (men: 7020, 6550 to 7480; women: 4760, 4530 to 4990), Lithuania (men: 5430, 4750 to 6070; women: 2640, 2310 to 2980), the US (men: 4350, 4170 to 4530; women: 2430, 2320 to 2550), Poland (men: 3830, 3540 to 4120; women: 1830, 1630 to 2040), and Hungary (men: 2770, 2490 to 3040; women: 1920, 1590 to 2240). The excess years of life lost were relatively low in people younger than 65 years, except in Russia, Bulgaria, Lithuania, and the US where the excess years of life lost was >2000 per 100 000.CONCLUSION: More than 28 million excess years of life were lost in 2020 in 31 countries, with a higher rate in men than women. Excess years of life lost associated with the covid-19 pandemic in 2020 were more than five times higher than those associated with the seasonal influenza epidemic in 2015.",

Nuclear variants were prioritised on the basis of gene panels chosen according to phenotypes, ClinVar pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, and the top 10 prioritised variants from Exomiser. Mitochondrial DNA variants were called using an in-house pipeline and compared with a list of pathogenic variants. Copy number variants and short tandem repeats for 13 neurological disorders were also analysed. American College of Medical Genetics guidelines were followed for classification of variants.MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Definite or probable genetic diagnosis.RESULTS: A definite or probable genetic diagnosis was identified in 98/319 (31%) families, with an additional 6 (2%) possible diagnoses. Fourteen of the diagnoses (4% of the 319 families) explained only part of the clinical features. A total of 95 different genes were implicated. Of 104 families given a diagnosis, 39 (38%) had a mitochondrial diagnosis and 65 (63%) had a non-mitochondrial diagnosis.CONCLUSION: Whole genome sequencing is a useful diagnostic test in patients with suspected mitochondrial disorders, yielding a diagnosis in a further 31% after exclusion of common causes. Most diagnoses were non-mitochondrial disorders and included developmental disorders with intellectual disability, epileptic encephalopathies, other metabolic disorders, cardiomyopathies, and leukodystrophies.

Recent reports suggest that Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) plays a key role in tumor progression and worsens the response to therapy, possibly through an association with a cancer stem cell (CSC) phenotype. The objective of our study was to investigate the relationship between SHH expression and CSC markers in OSCC.MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 67 OSCC specimens were immunostained for SHH and CSC markers using specific antibodies and expression was correlated with clinicopathological parameters.RESULTS: SHH expression was significantly correlated with CD133 (p=0.026, r=0.272) and SRY-box transcription factor 2 (SOX2; p<0.001, r=0.793). SHH and SOX2 expression were associated with worse survival in OSCC (p=0.003 and p=0.003, respectively). In multivariate analysis SHH and CD44 were independent prognostic biomarkers in patients with OSCC (p=0.001 and p=0.008, respectively).CONCLUSION: Our study revealed that SHH overexpression is closely associated with CSC markers, contributing to tumor progression and worse outcomes of patients with OSCC.",

This study focused on theta-defensins that have been shown to have anticancer properties.MATERIALS AND METHODS: RTD-2 analogs were synthesized on a peptide synthesizer. Cell viability was estimated using the MTT test. Immunoprecipitation assay was conducted to determine the molecular partner of the [Ser3,7,12,16]-RTD-2 analog.RESULTS: Here, we present the biologically active [Ser3,7,12,16]-RTD-2 analog that selectively targets various types of breast cancer cells. Immunoprecipitation protein-protein interaction studies showed eleven proteins common to MDA-MB-231 and T47D cell lines. Taking into account their cellular location, it can be concluded that the synthesized peptide interacts mainly with nuclear proteins, which correlates with the obtained microscopic image.CONCLUSION: Proteins that interact strongly with the [Ser3,7,12,16]-RTD-2 analog are closely related to the proteasomal protein degradation pathway. As the activity of the ubiquitin-proteasome system is markedly increased in patients with breast cancer, it is likely that selective modulation of this system may be a useful method for breast cancer treatment.",

In addition, multiplex immunofluorescence was used to examine immune cells in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) CRC and microsatellite stable (MSS) CRC.RESULTS: Proliferation rate and invasiveness of TREM1-over-expressing CRC cells were significantly greater than those of control cells (p<0.001 and 0.031, respectively), whereas SLAMF7-over-expressing CRC cells showed the opposite traits (p=0.005 and 0.002, respectively). SLAMF7-over-expressing DLD-1 cells harboring MSI-H showed increased apoptosis when treated with anti-PD-1 drugs, unlike SLAMF7-over-expressing SW480 cells harboring MSS. SLAMF7-over-expressing DLD1 and SW480 cells showed a marked increase in expression of the major cytokine mediator HMGB1 when exposed to anti-PD-1 drugs. Co-administration of anti-PD-1 drugs and TREM1 inhibitors induced apoptosis only in MSI-H HCT116 cells; HMGB1 was over-expressed regardless of microsatellite status.CONCLUSION: Expression of TREM1 and SLAMF7 is closely associated with immunogenic cell death, and TREM1 inhibitors may be an effective adjuvant that enhances anti-PD-1-mediated immunogenic cell death in MSS CRC.",

Thus, we examined the functional correlation between BAF57 expression and oncological malignancy in CRC in vitro.MATERIALS AND METHODS: BAF57 expression in WiDr and HT29 CRC cell lines and clinical specimens from CRC patients was analysed by western blotting and/or RT-PCR. BAF57 expression was down-regulated in WiDr cells through siRNA transfection. An invasion assay was also performed to assess malignancy.RESULTS: BAF57 was expressed in both human CRC cell lines. Overall survival and recurrence-free survival rates were significantly reduced in high BAF57-expressing specimens. BAF57 expression was an independent predictive factor for long-term survival.CONCLUSION: BAF57 correlates with oncological malignancy and may be a novel therapeutic target in CRC.",

Vitamin D signaling is mediated by vitamin D receptor (VDR) activated by 1�,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 [1,25(OH)2D3] and is also important in intestinal functions, such as calcium absorption and epithelial barrier maintenance. However, the crosstalk between vitamin D signaling and zinc signaling in intestinal cells remains poorly understood.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Colon cancer SW480 and HCT116 cells were treated with zinc chloride (ZnCl2) with/without 1,25(OH)2D3 Expression of zinc-inducible genes [metallothionein 1A (MT1A) and MT2A] and VDR target genes [cytochrome P450 family 24 subfamily A member 1 (CYP24A1), transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 6 (TRPV6) and cadherin 1 (CDH1)] was examined.RESULTS: Treatment of cells with ZnCl2 effectively induced MT1A and MT2A mRNA expression, and interestingly suppressed mRNA expression of CDH1, which was induced by 1,25(OH)2D3 in both cell lines. ZnCl2 also reduced the CDH1 protein level in HCT116 cells.CONCLUSION: Zinc signaling suppresses VDR-induced expression of CDH1.",

A traditional guaiac-based fecal occult blood test (gFOBT) test (HemoccultSENSA) was used as a reference.PATIENTS AND METHODS: A cohort of 509 colonoscopy-referral patients were asked to collect three consecutive fecal samples, to be analyzed by both CV and SENSA.RESULTS: In ROC analysis for the AA reading, the optimal cut-off value for CV Hb was ?8.0912 and that for CV Hb/Hp was ?1.8983. With these cut-offs, the sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), and efficiency of CV AA in detecting colorectal adenoma (CRA) were: 64.2%/78.6%, 53.4%/35.3%, and 58.6%/56.5%, for Hb and Hb/Hp, respectively. In the HSROC analysis, the AUC values for i) VA and ii) AA modes were as follows: i) AUC=0.551 (95%CI=0.500-0.602), ii) AUC=0.606 (95%CI=0.550-0.662). The difference between these AUC values was statistically significant (p=0.0160).CONCLUSION: The present study confirms the previous results on the applicability of the ColonView quick test in CRN screening. Of the two optional reading modes, the AA reading showed significantly better diagnostic accuracy as compared to the VA reading (or SENSA), in detecting the CRA endpoint in colonoscopy-referral patients.",

This clinical validation study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the new-generation GP test in detection of AG and Hp among gastroscopy referral patients in a University Clinic.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Altogether, 522 patients were enrolled among the patients referred for gastroscopy at the Gastro Center, Oulu University Hospital (OUH). All patients underwent gastroscopy with biopsies classified using the Updated Sydney System (USS), and blood sampling for GP testing.RESULTS: Biopsy-confirmed AG was found in 10.2% (53/511) of the patients. The overall agreement between the GP and the USS classification was 92.4% (95%CI=90.0-94.6%), with the weighted kappa (�w) of 0.861 (95%CI=0.834-0.883). In ROC analysis using moderate/severe AG of the corpus (AGC2+) as the endpoint, AUC=0.952 (95%CI=0.891-1.000) and AUC=0.998 (95%CI=0.996-1.000) for PGI and PGI/PGII, respectively. Hp IgG antibody ELISA detected biopsy-confirmed Hp-infection with AUC=0.993 (95%CI=0.987-0.999).CONCLUSION: The new generation GastroPanel� is a precise test for non-invasive diagnosis of atrophic gastritis and Hp-infection in dyspeptic patients referred for diagnostic gastroscopy.",

The aim of the study was to assess the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis, percentage of morphological types, survival, percentage of driving mutations, eligibility for radical surgery, and percentage of patients who undergo radical surgery, in the non-smoking population in comparison with smokers and former smokers.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The total number of patients in the registry at the time of the analysis was 2,743. Only 2,439 patients with complete records (smoking status, stage, and type of tumor) were included in this study.RESULTS: The analysis indicated that non-smokers are diagnosed at a later stage of the disease but they have a better survival rate than smokers. Fewer smokers with stage III disease who are eligible for radical surgery will undergo surgery compared to non-smokers with the same clinical stage. Driving mutations are more common in non-smokers, even after adjustment for the more frequent occurrence of adenocarcinoma in the group of non-smokers.CONCLUSION: The data from LUCAS registry are consistent with already known facts, suggesting that the LUCAS registry is a useful clinical tool.",

Additionally, we examined the association of HPV with survival.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Samples from 280 OSCC patients were analyzed for HPV-positivity using p16INK4a immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH)/LCD arrays, for HPV low and high-risk types. Only patients positive for both p16INK4a and HPV DNA were considered as HPV-positive. Survival probabilities and 95% confidence intervals were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess HPV association with disease-free survival (DFS), cause-specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS) in a competing risks scenario.RESULTS: Specimen from 30 (10.7%) patients were p16+ and HPV DNA+, while 31 (11.0%) were either p16+ or HPV DNA+ only. OS probabilities at five years for HPV-positive and -negative groups were 50.9% (35.4%-73.1%) and 52.9% (47.0%-59.5%), respectively. HPV double positivity influenced neither OS, CSS nor DFS: HR=0.84 (0.43-1.63), 1.64 (0.76-3.54) and 1.13 (0.55-2.35), respectively.CONCLUSION: In contrast to oropharyngeal cancer, the prevalence of HPV in OSCC is low and the presence of HPV does not influence survival outcomes. Hence, there is no evidence to support a parallel transfer of therapy regimen for HPV-positive OPC to OSCC, in terms of therapy de-escalation and/or vaccination.",

Although lateral pelvic lymph node dissection (LLND) might be an effective procedure for such patients, the associated risk factors for postoperative complications are unknown.PATIENTS AND METHODS: The operative outcomes of 21 patients undergoing unilateral LLND and 26 patients undergoing bilateral LLND for rectal cancer were compared. The risk factors for complications were evaluated using a logistic regression model.RESULTS: Univariate and multivariate analyses revealed that a longer operative time (?480 min) was the most important risk factor for grade II or more postoperative complications according to the Clavien-Dindo classification (odds ratio=6.58; 95% confidence interval=1.35-32.1; p=0.020). A bilateral procedure was not a significant risk factor for postoperative complications.CONCLUSION: Surgeons should make efforts to shorten the operative time to reduce the risk of postoperative complications.",

The present study evaluated the safety and feasibility of gastrectomy for gastric cancer in patients who received antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation therapy in the perioperative period.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Cases were selected from the medical records of consecutive patients who were diagnosed with gastric cancer and underwent complete resection at the Kanagawa Cancer Center from 2013 to 2017. The patients were divided into the antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation treatment group and the non-antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation treatment group.RESULTS: Five hundred and six patients underwent gastrectomy for gastric cancer and were analyzed in the present study. Among them, 62 patients (12.3%) received anticoagulation therapy (anticoagulation group). When the anticoagulation and non-anticoagulation groups were compared, although there were some differences in patient background factors, the surgical findings, perioperative clinical course, and details of postoperative complications were similar. The incidence of postoperative bleeding was 0.8% (4/506) in all patients. The incidence of postoperative bleeding was 1.6% (1/62) in the anticoagulation group and 0.7% (3/446) in the non-anticoagulation group. Preoperative anticoagulation therapy was not identified as a significant independent risk factor for postoperative bleeding.CONCLUSION: These results suggest that curative gastrectomy for gastric cancer is safe and feasible, regardless of the perioperative use of antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation treatment. In addition, the perioperative use of antiplatelet and/or anticoagulation treatment was not a significant risk factor for postoperative bleeding after gastrectomy for gastric cancer.",

This chapter outlines all of the currently available ligand kinetic data, providing a repository that contains the largest publicly available source of GPCR-ligand kinetic data to date. To help decipher the features of kinetic data that might be beneficial to include in computational models for the prediction of residence time, the experimental evidence for properties that influence residence time are summarized.

Specifically, AI brings together the potential to improve drug approval rates, reduce development costs, get medications to patients faster, and help patients complying with their treatments. Accelerated pharmaceutical development and drug product approval rates can further benefit from the quantum computing (QC) technology, which will ultimately enable larger profits from patent-protected market exclusivity.Key pharma stakeholders are endorsing cutting-edge technologies based on AI and QC , covering drug discovery, preclinical and clinical development, and postapproval activities. Indeed, AI-QC applications are expected to become standard in the pharma operating model over the next 5-10�years. Generalizing scalability to larger pharmaceutical problems instead of specialization is now the main principle for transforming pharmaceutical tasks on multiple fronts, for which systematic and cost-effective solutions have benefited in areas such as molecular screening, synthetic pathway design, and drug discovery and development.The information generated by coupling the life cycle of drugs and AI and/or QC through data-driven analysis, neural network prediction, and chemical system monitoring will enable (1) better understanding of the complexity of process data, (2) streamlining the design of experiments, (3) discovering new molecular targets and materials, and also (4) planning or rethinking upcoming pharmaceutical challenges The power of AI-QC makes accessible a range of different pharmaceutical problems and their rationalization that have not been previously addressed due to a lack of appropriate analytical tools, demonstrating the breadth of potential applications of these emerging multidimensional approaches. In this context, creating the right AI-QC strategy often involves a steep learning path, especially given the embryonic stage of the industry development and the relative lack of case studies documenting success.

Together, these move the industry toward improved developability , lower costs, and broader access of biotherapeutics .",

The opportunity for the application of AI/ML based approaches in the pharmaceutical industry is driven by the abundance of data sets that exist within individual pharmaceutical and biotech companies and the availability, within these environments, of abundant computing power. This chapter seeks to describe opportunities for artificial intelligence to contribute to the assessment and evaluation of the dug metabolism and pharmacokinetic (DMPK) properties of novel compounds across the drug discovery and development continuum. Many initiatives are already underway with respect to the application of AI/ML in predicting pharmacokinetic profiles so the question is not whether AI will influence pharmacokinetic prediction but rather how to best utilize and incorporate this and how to evaluate the value added from these applications. Since our understanding of the underlying biology of the in vitro and in vivo systems with respect to ADME, one of the key challenges to AI-based methods will be the ability to adapt to data sets that change in quality over time.",

The aim of this work is to quantitatively summarize the results of both randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and non-randomized studies of interventions (NRSIs) comparing fluoropyrimidine-HAI (F-HAI) to systemic chemotherapy (SCT) for the treatment of colorectal liver metastases (CRLMs).METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Library, PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science up to July 1, 2021. The outcome measures were tumor response rate and overall survival (OS). Both RCTs and NRSIs comparing HAI to SCT for patients with unresectable CRLMs were included. The outcome measures were tumor response rate and OS. Two reviewers assessed trial quality and extracted data independently. All statistical analyses were performed using standard statistical procedures provided in Review Manager 5.2.RESULTS: A total of 16 studies including 11 RCTs and 5 NRSIs were identified for the present meta-analysis. Nine RCTs compared F-HAI to SCT for patients with unresectable CRLMs and the pooled result indicated that patients who received F-HAI experienced more than twofold response rate than SCT, with a pooled risk ratio of 2.10 (95%CI 1.59-2.79; P < .00001). In addition, the pooled result based on RCTs showed that F-HAI had a significant benefit regarding OS, with a pooled HR of 0.83 (95% CI 0.70-0.99; P = .04). Similarly, the benefit of F-HAI in terms of OS was also observed in the results of NRSIs.CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicated that the F-HAI regimen had a greater tumor response rate and survival advantage than SCT for patients with unresectable CRLMs. Future propensity score-matched analyses with a large sample size should be conducted to support the evidence of our results based on RCTs and NRSIs.",

However, FP has not been categorized in the manual for abdominal ultrasound in cancer screening and health check-ups in Japan, and the pathology of FP has not been fully elucidated.Nine hundred and nineteen people who underwent a medical check-up had the severity of their pancreatic fat accumulation categorized after transabdominal ultrasonographic examination. The relationships between FP, lifestyle-related diseases, and fatty liver disease at this time were assessed using stratification analysis.The prevalence of FP was 46.8% (430/919). People with FP were more likely to be male and had higher prevalences of lifestyle-related diseases, including fatty liver disease. Men and women were similarly represented in each tertile of pancreas brightness. Older age; high waist circumference, triglyceride and glucose index, serum low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, hepatic steatosis index; and low serum amylase were associated with the presence of severe FP. Moreover, the group with severe liver steatosis had a higher prevalence of FP and a higher pancreatic brightness score. Logistic regression analysis showed that individuals with liver steatosis were more likely to have severe FP.The severity of FP is associated with features of lifestyle-related diseases and the severity of liver steatosis. These findings suggest that high visceral fat content is associated with more severe fatty pancreas as a phenotype of ectopic fat accumulation, as well as fatty liver disease.",

Nevertheless, the association between uric acid levels and the development of albuminuria has been under-investigated in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Patients with type 2 diabetes and regular outpatient visits were recruited from the Puli Branch of the Taichung Veterans General Hospital in Taiwan since January 2014. Demographics, lifestyle features, and medical history were gathered by well-trained interviewers. All participants underwent comprehensive physical examinations, including a biochemical assay of venous blood specimens and urine samples after an 8-hour overnight fast. Participants were followed until June 2018. The primary outcome was the albuminuria incidence. Univariable and multivariable Cox regression analysis were employed to explore the relation between uric acid and incident albuminuria. Uric acid cutoffs for incident albuminuria were determined with the receiver operator characteristic curve. We included 247 qualified subjects (mean age: 64.78 years old [standard deviation = 11.29 years]; 138 [55.87%] men). During a 4.5-year follow-up duration, 20 subjects with incident albuminuria were recognized. Serum uric acid was significantly associated with an increased risk of incident albuminuria (adjusted hazard ratio = 2.39; 95% confidence interval: 1.53-3.75; P < .001) with potential confounders adjustment. The uric acid cutoff point was 6.9 mg/dL (area under the curve 0.708, sensitivity 60.0%, specificity 84.58%) for incident albuminuria. Serum uric acid was associated with incident albuminuria among patients with type 2 diabetes.",

Then the vitamin D levels and its influencing factors were analyzed, and the relationships between vitamin D levels and common adverse pregnancy outcomes in the pregnant women as well as the incidence of small-for-gestational-age newborns were analyzed.RESULTS: The vitamin D deficiency rate, insufficiency rate and sufficiency rate of pregnant women were 83.28%, 15.36%, and 1.36% respectively, with vast majority of the pregnant women in a state of vitamin D deficiency. Analysis of the influencing factors on the vitamin D level of pregnant women showed \"28 weeks ? gestational age ?32 weeks, summer and autumn, high school education and above, weekly time outdoors ?10 hours, supplement of vitamin D and trace elements during pregnancy\" were protective factors for vitamin D sufficiency in pregnant women. Linear correlation analysis showed the vitamin D level of pregnant women was highly positively correlated with temperature, the higher the temperature, the higher the vitamin D level (r = 0.907, t = 6.818, P < .001). The level of vitamin D in pregnant women was related to the occurrence of spontaneous abortion and small-for-gestational age (SGA), with the incidence of spontaneous abortion and SGA in the \"vitamin D deficiency group\" higher than those of other groups (P = .018, P = .016).CONCLUSIONS: The vitamin D level of pregnant women in this area is relatively low, which is affected by multiple factors such as gestational age, season, education level of pregnant women, weekly time outdoors, vitamin D and trace element supplement during pregnancy. Low vitamin D levels can increase the risk of spontaneous abortion and SGA in pregnant women, so relevant measures should be adopted to improve the vitamin D status of pregnant women.",

Both groups received basic treatment and conventional rehabilitation. In the treatment group, patients were treated with active tDCS, while in the control group, sham tDCS. Both active and sham tDCS were administered 6 times a week for 4 weeks. Before and after the trial, the Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS), Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and Modified Barthel Index (MBI) were evaluated and analyzed. And comparisons were made among groups. And there were an 8-week follow-up after the intervention.RESULT: Before the intervention, there were no significant differences in baseline data and assessment scores between the groups (P > 0.05). After 4 weeks of intervention, FSS scores in the treatment group were significantly lower than those in the control group (P = 0.012), and FMA and BMI scores were significantly higher than those in the control group (P < 0.05).

Obesity and non-obesity groups were matched with sex, age, urbanization level, socioeconomic status, and the related comorbidities by using the propensity score method at a 1:2 ratio.An obese cohort (n = 4140) and a non-obese cohort (n = 8280) were included in this study, with an average age of 41.7 � 13.8 years and 42.0 � 14.0 years, respectively. The risk of CP for the patients with obesity was 1.12-fold compared with those without obesity (hazard ratio, 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.25). In the subgroup analysis according to age and sex, the hazard ratio of CP were 1.98 (95% confidence interval, 1.22-3.22) in the subgroup of age equal to or older than 65 years. The risk of CP showed no difference between obesity and non-obesity groups in both sex.This population-based cohort study demonstrated that obesity was associated with the development of CP in Taiwan.",

The Stata14 software was used to test the heterogeneity of the original study that met the inclusion criteria, to calculate the combined sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio, the prior probability and posttest probability. The summary receiver operator characteristic curve was drawn and the area under the curve was calculated. Using Deeks funnel plot to evaluate publication bias.RESULTS: Five studies were finally included, including 298 GGN cases. The included studies had no obvious heterogeneity and publication bias. The combined sensitivity and specificity of PET/CT for predicting invasive adenocarcinoma presenting as GGN were 0.74 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.68-0.79), 0.82 (95% CI: 0.71-0.90), positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 4.1 (95% CI: 2.5-6.9), 0.32 (95% CI: 0.25-0.40), and the diagnostic odds ratio was 13 (95% CI: 7-26). The prior probability is 20%, the probability of GGN being invasive adenocarcinoma when PET/CT was negative was reduced to 7%, and the probability of GGN being invasive adenocarcinoma when PET/CT was positive was increased to 51%. The area under the curve of the summary receiver operator characteristic curve was 0.85.CONCLUSION: PET/CT has high diagnostic accuracy for invasive adenocarcinoma presenting as GGN.",

Bioinformatics analyses including differentially expressed genes (DEGs), enriched functions and pathways (EFPs), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were carried out in DMED and CNIED rats in this study. The critical biomarkers that may intervene in nitric oxide synthase (NOS, predominantly nNOS, ancillary eNOS, and iNOS)-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-phosphodiesterase 5 enzyme (PDE5) pathway, an important mechanism in erectile dysfunction treatment, were then explored for potential clinical applications.METHODS: GSE2457 and GSE31247 were downloaded. Their DEGs with a |logFC (fold change)| > 0 were screened out. Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) online database was used to analyze the EFPs in Gene Ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes networks based on down-regulated and up-regulated DEGs respectively. PPI analysis of 2 datasets was performed in Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) and Cytoscape. Interactions with an average score greater than 0.9 were chosen as the cutoff for statistical significance.RESULTS: From a total of 1710 DEGs in GSE2457, 772 were down-regulated and 938 were up-regulated, in contrast to the 836 DEGs in GSE31247, from which 508 were down-regulated and 328 were up-regulated. The 25 common EFPs such as aging and response to hormone were identified in both models. PPI results showed that the first 10 hub genes in DMED were all different from those in CNIED.CONCLUSIONS: The intervention of iNOS with the hub gene complement component 3 in DMED and the aging process in both DMED and CNIED deserves attention.",

Sound therapy has increased in popularity due to its potential for increased efficacy and fewer and milder side effects, but the available evidence is limited by the lack of randomized controlled trials comparing different sound therapies for tinnitus. Network meta-analysis (NMA) is a useful tool to compare multiple treatments when there is limited or no direct evidence available. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy and acceptability of different sound therapies for tinnitus.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A literature search was conducted to identify articles in EMBASE, PubMed/MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature, and Wanfang and Weipu from inception to April 1, 2021. The Tinnitus Handicap Inventory, Tinnitus Questionnaire, and effective rate were used to assess perceived tinnitus suppression after treatment. We used Review Manager 5.4 for the standard meta-analysis; R 4.0.4 and Stata 15.1 were used for the NMA and the publication bias and sensitivity analyses.RESULTS: The effect estimates of the direct comparisons (when available) were very similar to those of the NMA. Overall, sound stimulation alone performed better than medication alone, educational consultation alone, and no treatment. Combination therapy, such as sound stimulation plus educational consultation and sound stimulation plus drug therapy, yielded significantly better outcomes with regard to the alleviation of tinnitus than individual treatments.CONCLUSION: This is the first NMA to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of different sound therapies for the management of tinnitus. It may help inform the selection of sound therapy and the development of guidelines in clinical practice. Future studies of sound therapy with larger sample sizes involving multiple medical centers are needed to improve the current evidence.",

To stratify learning curves based on procedure to evaluate the effect of experience on surgical complexity.The learning curve for spine surgery is difficult to quantify, but is useful information for hospital administrators/surgical programs/new graduates, so appropriate expectations and accommodations are considered.Data from a retrospective cohort (2014-2016) were analyzed at a quaternary academic institution servicing a geographically-isolated, mostly rural area. Procedures included anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, posterior cervical decompression and stabilization, single and 2-level posterior lumbar interbody fusion, lumbar discectomy, and laminectomy. Data related to patient demographics, after-hours surgery, and revision surgery were collected. Operative time was the primary outcome measure, with secondary measures including cerebrospinal fluid leak and early re-operation. Time periods were stratified into 6 month quarters (quarter [Q] 1-Q4), with STATA software used for statistical analysis.There were 626 patients meeting inclusion criteria. The senior surgeon had similar operative times throughout the study. The new surgeon demonstrated a decrease in operative time from Q1 to Q4 (158 minutes-119 minutes, P < .05); however, the mean operative time was shorter for the senior surgeon at 2 years (91 minutes, P < .05). The senior surgeon performed more revision surgeries (odds ratio [OR] 2.5 [95% confidence interval [CI] 1.7-3.6]; P < .001). Posterior interbody fusion times remained longer for the new surgeon, while laminectomy surgery was similar to the senior surgeon by 2 years. There were no differences in rates of cerebrospinal fluid leak (OR 1.2 [95% CI 0.6-2.5]; P > .05), nor reoperation (OR 1.16 [95% CI 0.7-1.9]; P > .05) between surgeons.A significant learning curve exists starting spine practice and likely extends beyond the first 2 years for elective operations.",

Patients with LMR ? 3.6 and LMR < 3.6 were scored 0 and 1, respectively. Patients with preserved u-Ig levels, suppression of 1 u-Ig, and suppression of at least 2 u-Igs were scored 0, 1, and 2, respectively. The immune score, established from these individual scores, was used to separate patients into good (0-1 points), intermediate (2 points), and poor (3 points) risk groups. The baseline data, objective remission rate (ORR), whether receive maintenance treatment regularly and overall survival of patients before treatment were analyzed.The ORR of the good-risk group was significantly higher than that of the intermediate-risk group (75.6% vs 57.7%, P = .044) and the poor-risk group (75.6% vs 48.2%, P = .007).

For MTHFR rs1801131 (A1298C) SNP, increased risk of HCC was only observed in Caucasians (allelic: OR = 1.86, 95% CI = [1.49, 2.31]; homozygote: OR = 3.39, 95% CI = [2.18, 5.27]), interesting decreased risk was detected in Mongoloid (recessive: OR = 0.30, 95% CI = [0.15, 0.58]; homozygote: OR = 0.41, 95% CI = [0.24, 0.72]). Sensitivity analysis indicated stability in our results. Publication bias was not detected based on Begg test and Egger test. Trial sequential analysis indicated further studies to confirm the associations in MTHFR C677T polymorphism.CONCLUSION: The MTHFR rs1801133 SNP was associated with an increased risk of HCC in Mongoloid population especially in Chinese. Increased HCC risk is also observed in Caucasian population for the MTHFR rs1801131 SNP, and decreased risk of HCC is remarkably discovered in Mongoloid and Chinese subgroups, which need further validation.",

This study aimed to compare these types of diarrhea.We included patients with COVID-19 in a cohort study and excluded patients with chronic diarrhea, laxative use, and those who died during the first day of hospitalization.There were 89 (9.3%), 161 (16.7%), and 731 (75.7%) patients with early viral, late antibiotic-associated, and without diarrhea, respectively. Late diarrhea lasted longer (6 [4-10] vs 5 [3-7] days, P < .001) and was more severe. Clostridioides difficile was found in 70.5% of tested patients with late diarrhea and in none with early diarrhea. Presence of late diarrhea was associated with an increased risk of death after 20 days of disease (P = .009; hazard ratio = 4.7). Patients with late diarrhea had a longer hospital stay and total disease duration, and a higher proportion of these patients required intensive care unit admission. Oral amoxicillin/clavulanate (odds ratio [OR] = 2.23), oral clarithromycin (OR = 3.79), and glucocorticoids (OR = 4.41) use was a risk factor for the development of late diarrhea, while ceftriaxone use (OR = 0.35) had a protective effect. Before the development of late diarrhea, decrease in C-reactive protein levels and increase in lymphocyte count stopped but the white blood cell and neutrophil count increased. An increase in neutrophils by >0.6 ? 109 cells/L predicted the development of late diarrhea in the coming days (sensitivity 82.0%, specificity 70.8%, area under the curve = 0.791 [0.710-0.872]).Diarrhea in COVID-19 is heterogeneous, and different types of diarrhea require different management.",

A total of 60 patients with CSD and uterine fibroids or benign ovarian tumors who underwent cesarean section were included, and divided into the CSD group and control group. Baseline characteristics of all patients were collected, and the pelvic adhesion scores and the percents of tubal patency were evaluated. Furthermore, the postoperative clinical outcomes were followed up. The levels of inflammatory factors in pelvic fluid were tested using Elisa kits.Preoperative data indicated that the size of the uterine scar diverticulum was (1.68 � 0.52) cm, the pelvic adhesion scores were higher in CSD group than control group (4.67 � 0.90 vs 0.47 � 0.90, P < .05), and 21 of 30 patients with unobstructed fallopian tubes. The levels of tumor necrosis factor-�, interleukin-1�, and interleukin-6 in patients with CSD were obviously higher than control group (P < .05). After the follow-up, the data displayed that no CSD was found in all patients, the time of menstrual period in patients with CSD was shortened to 7.80 � 1.27 days, and the myometrial thickness at uterine scar was significantly increased (P < .05). Additionally, the pregnancy rate was increased, and 12 of 30 patients were repregnant. Correlation analysis showed that the levels of inflammatory factors (tumor necrosis factor-�, interleukin-1�, interleukin-6), the size of uterine scar diverticulum, and the myometrial thickness at uterine scar were significantly correlated with subsequent infertility (r = 0.307, 0.083, 0.147, 0.405, 0.291, P < .05).Uterine scar diverticulum repair could improve menstrual prolongation, increased the thickness of myometrium and repregnant rate. Subsequent infertility was positively correlated with uterine scar diverticulum and the levels of inflammatory factors.",

However, the impact of pain on changes in PA during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is unknown. The purpose of this study was to examine whether PA levels pre-, during, and post-COVID-19 state of emergency differ between Japanese adults who had pain after the COVID-19 state of emergency and those who did not.Data were collected from a cross-sectional online survey conducted between October 19 and 28, 2020. The analytic sample consisted of 1967 Japanese adults aged ?40 years who completed the online survey. Participants completed questionnaires on the presence of pain and duration of PA, defined as the total PA time per week based on activity frequency and time. Participants were asked to report their PA at 3 time points: October 2019 (before the COVID-19 pandemic), April 2020 (during the COVID-19 state of emergency), and October 2020 (after the COVID-19 state of emergency).Among participants aged ?60 years who reported pain in October 2020, the total PA time was significantly lower than participants who did not report having pain. Furthermore, the total PA time in April 2020 was significantly lower than that in October 2019; however, no significant difference in total PA time was observed between April and October 2020. Among participants aged 40 to 59 years, no significant differences were observed in total PA times at the 3 time points between those with and without pain. In addition, the total PA time in October 2020 significantly increased compared to that in April 2020, although it significantly decreased in April 2020 compared to October 2019.This study suggests that older adults with pain have lower PA levels after the COVID-19 state of emergency.",

However, the role of eRNAs in gastric cancer, especially the prognosis-associated eRNAs, has not been studied yet.In this study, we have used a novel approach to screened key eRNAs in gastric cancer. Kaplan-Meier correlation analysis and Co-expression analysis were used to find the most significant survival-associated eRNAs. Enrichment analysis is applied to explore the key functions and pathways of screened eRNAs. The correlation and survival analysis are used to evaluate targeted genes in the pan-cancer analysisA total of 63 prognostic-associated eRNAs in gastric cancer were identified, the top 6 eRNAs were LINC01714, ZNF192P1, AC079760.2, LINC01645, EMX2OS, and AC114489.2. The correlation analysis demonstrated the top 10 screened eRNAs and their targeted genes. The results demonstrated that EMX2OS was ranked as the top eRNA according to the results of the Kaplan-Meier analysis. The correlation analysis demonstrated that eRNA EMX2OS is correlated with age, grade, stage, and cancer status. The pan-cancer analysis demonstrated that EMX2OS was associated with poor survival outcomes in adrenocortical carcinoma, cervical squamous cell carcinoma and endocervical adenocarcinoma, kidney renal clear cell carcinoma, stomach adenocarcinoma, and uveal melanoma.In this study, survival-related eRNAs were screened and the correlation between survival-related eRNAs and their targeted genes was demonstrated. EMX2OS plays a prognosis-associated eRNA role in gastric cancer, which might be a novel therapeutic target in clinical practice.",

Although CTS progression is known to be associated with thenar muscle (TM) atrophy, the diagnostic value of TM atrophy for CTS has not been established. In this research, the thenar muscle cross-sectional area (TMCSA) was evaluated to analyze the relationship between the TMCSA and CTS. We assumed that TMCSA is a major diagnostic parameter in the CTS.Both TMCSA and thenar muscle thickness (TMT) samples were acquired from 18 CTS patients, and from 18 control subjects who underwent wrist magnetic resonance imaging with no evidence of CTS. T2-weighted transverse magnetic resonance imaging images were obtained. We measured the TMCSA and TMT at the level of first carpometacarpal joint.The average TMCSA was 296.98 � 49.39 mm2 in the normal group and 203.36 � 72.13 mm2 in the CTS group. The average TMT was 8.54 � 1.45 mm in the normal group and 7.38 � 1.14 mm in the CTS group. CTS group had significantly lower TMCSA and TMT. Receiver operator characteristics curve analysis showed that the best cutoff point for the TMCSA was 260.18 mm2, with 77.8% sensitivity, 77.8% specificity. The best cutoff point of the TMT was 7.70 mm, with 61.1% sensitivity, 66.7% specificity.Although the TMCSA and TMT were both significantly associated with CTS, the TMCSA was a much more sensitive measurement parameter. Thus, to evaluate CTS patients, the physician should more carefully inspect the TMCSA than TMT.",

From the collected data, ALB-based ratios (LDH/ALB, blood urea nitrogen to albumin, C-reactive protein to albumin, and lactate to albumin ratios) and some severity scores (modified early warning score, mortality in emergency department sepsis score [MEDS], and Acute Physiology And Chronic Health Evaluation II [APACHE II] score) were calculated. LDH/ALB ratio for predicting the in-hospital mortality was compared with other ALB-based ratios and severity scales by univariable and receiver-operating characteristics curve analysis. Modified severity scores by LDH/ALB ratio and multivariable logistic regression were used to verify the independence and usefulness of the LDH/ALB ratio.The median LDH/ALB ratio was higher in non-survivors than survivors (166.9 [interquartile range: 127.2-233.1] vs 214.7 [interquartile range: 160.2-309.7], P < .001). The area under the receiver-operating characteristics curve of the LDH/ALB ratio (0.642, 95% confidence interval: 0.602-0.681, P < .001) was not lower than that of other ALB-based ratios and severity scores. From multivariable logistic regression, LDH/ALB ratio was independently associated with in-hospital mortality (odds ratio = 1.001, 95% confidence interval: 1.000-1.002, P = .047). Area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves of MEDS and APACHE II scores were improved by modification with LDH/ALB ratio (MEDS: 0.643 vs 0.680, P < .001; APACHE II score: 0.675 vs 0.700, P = .003).LDH/ALB ratio may be useful as the prognostic factor in patients with severe infection requiring intensive care.",

The biopsy indication was considered high prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and/or suspicious digital rectal prostate examination findings. Patients' ages, underlying diseases, PSA levels, prostate volumes, pathologic results, and infectious complications after the biopsy were investigated. All the patients received 1500 mg of ciprofloxacin (750 mg twice a day) for 5 days, starting from the day before the procedure. Forty-seven (41.96%) patients received ciprofloxacin prophylaxis with povidone-iodine transrectal injection, while 65 (58.03%) only received ciprofloxacin prophylaxis. All the patients, who were readmitted to the hospital after the procedure, especially with a temperature of higher than 37.8�C, were detected. For the purposes of the study, the priority was placed on the emergence of the rate of febrile infectious complications. Differences in febrile infectious complications in patients, who received ciprofloxacin prophylaxis with transrectal povidone-iodine, and those, who received ciprofloxacin prophylaxis alone before TRUS-Bx, were studied.Febrile infectious complications developed in 10 cases (15.38%) in patients, who received ciprofloxacin antibiotics prophylaxis alone. In the povidone-iodine rectal disinfection group, there was only 1 case of febrile infectious complication (2%). There was no significant difference by clinicopathologic features, age, PSA level, and cancer detection rate between both groups (P > .05). Multivariate logistic regression analysis did not identify any patient subgroups at a significantly higher risk of infection after prostate biopsy. There was no significant side effect associated with povidone iodine.In addition to the use of prophylactic antibiotics, transrectal povidone-iodine was useful in reducing the febrile infection complications following TRUS-Bx.",

IBS was diagnosed according to the Rome III criteria and was based on the presence of abdominal pain or discomfort for at least 3 months during the previous 6 months, with at least 2 or more of the following conditions: changes in frequency or form of stool and/or decrease in pain after defecation. We adjusted for confounding factors, including age, only child (yes or no), parents' educational levels (senior high school or below, college, or postgraduate), parents' marital status (married, widowed, or divorced), smoking status (smoker or nonsmoker), drinking status (drinker or nondrinker), body mass index, and depressive symptoms. A multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the relationship between breakfast frequency and the risk of IBS.Among 706 participants, 23.7% were the only child in their family, and the proportion of parents divorced or widowed was 18.5%. The proportion of fathers and mothers with high school education or above was 93.3% and 96.3%, respectively. The prevalence of IBS among the participants was 17.3% (122/706). Multivariate logistic regressions analysis showed that breakfast consumption frequency is negatively associated with the risk of IBS after adjusting for confounding factors. The odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for IBS in the breakfast frequency category of 0 to 3 times/week, 4 to 6 times/week, and daily were 1.00 (reference), 0.96 (0.58, 1.60), and 0.45 (0.26, 0.78), respectively (P = .002).Our data revealed that regular breakfast consumption is associated with a lower risk of IBS among Chinese college students. Future cohort and/or interventional studies should be conducted to further explore the association between breakfast consumption frequency and IBS.",

The patient was treated with 30 Gy in 5 fractions for new lesions and 25 Gy in 5 fractions for lesion that were locally recurrent and close to brainstem lesions.OUTCOME: The lesions were well-controlled, and the headache of the patient was significantly relieved one month after radiotherapy. The total survival time of the patients was 17 months from the beginning of the Cyberknife treatment.CONCLUSION: The present case report demonstrates that CyberKnife therapy plays a significant role in the repeated radiotherapy for multiple metastatic brain tumors. CKSRT can be used as a salvage method in recurrent multiple brain metastases.",

The medical records of 101 AYA patients and 175 control patients with OTSCC who underwent surgery were reviewed. Variables related to prognosis and their clinicopathological associations were analyzed. The 5-year overall survival (5y-OS) rates of AYA and control patients with stage I and II OTSCC were 94.4% and 89.6% (P = .353), respectively, and their 5-year disease-free survival (5y-DFS) rates were 82.0% and 76.6%, respectively (P = .476). The 5y-OS rates of patients with stages III and IV OTSCC were 83.3% and 66.7% (P = .333), respectively, and their 5y-DFS rates were 75.0% and 57.1% (P = .335), respectively. Logistic regression analysis revealed that there was no significant clinicopathological difference in AYA and control group. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in 5y-OS rates between patients who underwent elective neck dissection (END) and those who underwent therapeutic neck dissection (TND) in both group (P = 0.717 and 0.688). Overall, the present study revealed the clinicopathological features and prognosis of OTSCC were similar in AYA patients and elderly patients. Moreover, as there was no significant difference in OS between patients who underwent END and those who underwent TND in AYA and control groups, our results suggest that the indication for END in AYA patients with clinical N0 OTSCC is similar to that for elderly patients.",

Paradoxically, most counties do not exhibit this same multiwave pattern. We aim to answer three research questions: (1) How many distinct clusters of counties exhibit similar COVID-19 patterns in the time-series of daily confirmed cases? (2) What is the geographic distribution of the counties within each cluster? and (3) Are county-level demographic, socioeconomic and political variables associated with the COVID-19 case patterns?MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from counties in the U.S. from March 1, 2020 to January 2, 2021. Time series clustering identified clusters in the daily confirmed cases of COVID-19. An explanatory model was used to identify demographic, socioeconomic and political variables associated with the outbreak patterns.RESULTS: Three patterns were identified from the cluster solution including counties in which cases are still increasing, those that peaked in the late fall, and those with low case counts to date. Several county-level demographic, socioeconomic, and political variables showed significant associations with the identified clusters.DISCUSSION: The pattern of the outbreak is related both to the geographic location within the U.S. and several variables including population density and government response.CONCLUSION: The reported pattern of cases in the U.S. is observed through aggregation of the daily confirmed COVID-19 cases, suggesting that local trends may be more informative. The pattern of the outbreak varies by county, and is associated with important demographic, socioeconomic, political and geographic factors.",

The aims of this study were (1) to estimate the extent to which perceptions and expectations regarding the social, economic, and domestic effects of the COVID-19 outbreak are associated with psychological distress and (2) to identify some demographic, psychosocial, and economic factors associated with increased vulnerability to psychological distress during the COVID-19 outbreak in Chile. 1078 people participated in a telephone survey between May 30 and June 10, 2020. The sample is representative of the Chilean adult population. Psychological distress was assessed through a questionnaire of anxious and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-4). We analyzed the data set using ordinary least-squares regression models, first estimating models for the entire sample, and then stratifying the sample into different groups to explore differences by gender and age. 19.2% of participants displayed significant psychological distress (PHQ-4 ? 6), with moderate to severe anxiety-depression symptoms being more prevalent in women than in men (23.9% vs 14.1%, �2 16.78, p<0.001). The results of this study suggest that being a woman, feeling lonely and isolated, living in the areas hit hardest by the pandemic and lockdown, expecting a lack of income due to having to stop working as a consequence of the pandemic, and having a history of diagnosed mental disorders are significantly associated with psychological distress (p<0.05). The results of this study highlight the need to implement psychosocial programs to guard people's psychological well-being and social policies to address economic uncertainty during the current COVID-19 outbreak in Chile.",

This study describes and compares two methods for predicting near-term SARS-CoV-2 incidence in West Virginia counties. The first method, Rt Only, is solely based on producing forecasts for each county using the daily instantaneous reproductive numbers, Rt. The second method, ML+Rt, is a machine learning approach that uses a Long Short-Term Memory network to predict the near-term number of cases for each county using epidemiological statistics such as Rt, county population information, and time series trends including information on major holidays, as well as leveraging statewide COVID-19 trends across counties and county population size. Both approaches used daily county-level SARS-CoV-2 incidence data provided by the West Virginia Department Health and Human Resources beginning April 2020. The methods are compared on the accuracy of near-term SARS-CoV-2 increases predictions by county over 17 weeks from January 1, 2021- April 30, 2021. Both methods performed well (correlation between forecasted number of cases and the actual number of cases week over week is 0.872 for the ML+Rt method and 0.867 for the Rt Only method) but differ in performance at various time points. Over the 17-week assessment period, the ML+Rt method outperforms the Rt Only method in identifying larger spikes. Results show that both methods perform adequately in both rural and non-rural predictions. Finally, a detailed discussion on practical issues regarding implementing forecasting models for public health action based on Rt is provided, and the potential for further development of machine learning methods that are enhanced by Rt.",

Using retrospective longitudinal time-use diary data collected from a demographically diverse sample of over 760 UK adults in both lockdowns, we found significant changes in both the quantity and quality of time spent on broad activity categories (employment, housework, leisure). Individuals spent less time on employment-related activities (in addition to a reduction in time spent commuting) and more time on housework. These effects were concentrated on individuals with young children. Individuals also spent more time doing leisure activities (e.g. hobbies) alone and conducting employment-related activities outside normal working hours, changes that were significantly correlated with decreases in overall enjoyment. Changes in quality exacerbated existing inequalities in quantity of time use, with parents of young children being disproportionately affected. These findings indicate that quality of time use is another important consideration for policy design and evaluation.",

Multiple safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19 are available with one-third of the global population now vaccinated. Achieving a sufficient level of vaccine coverage to suppress COVID-19 requires, in part, sufficient acceptance among the public. However, relatively high rates of hesitance and resistance to COVID-19 vaccination persists, threating public health efforts to achieve vaccine-induced population protection. In this study, we examined longitudinal changes in COVID-19 vaccine acceptance, hesitance, and resistance in two nations (the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) during the first nine months of the pandemic, and identified individual and psychological factors associated with consistent non-acceptance of COVID-19 vaccination. Using nationally representative, longitudinal data from the United Kingdom (UK; N = 2025) and Ireland (N = 1041), we found that (1) COVID-19 vaccine acceptance declined in the UK and remained unchanged in Ireland following the emergence of approved vaccines; (2) multiple subgroups existed reflecting people who were consistently willing to be vaccinated ('Accepters': 68% in the UK and 61% in Ireland), consistently unwilling to be vaccinated ('Deniers': 12% in the UK and 16% in Ireland), and who fluctuated over time ('Moveable Middle': 20% in the UK and 23% in Ireland); and (3) the 'deniers' and 'moveable middle' were distinguishable from the 'accepters' on a range of individual (e.g., younger, low income, living alone) and psychological (e.g., distrust of scientists and doctors, conspiracy mindedness) factors. The use of two high-income, Western European nations limits the generalizability of these findings. Nevertheless, understanding how receptibility to COVID-19 vaccination changes as the pandemic unfolds, and the factors that distinguish and characterise those that are hesitant and resistant to vaccination is helpful for public health efforts to achieve vaccine-induced population protection against COVID-19.",

In this regard, it is important to study which factors primarily affect the happiness of the population. In principle, these factors are associated with income level and residential and job stability, or more specifically, citizens' quality of life. This research, which is based on a multidimensional concept of quality of life, uses a regression model to explain the dependence of Spaniards' happiness on the well-being or quality of life provided by their work, their family situation, their income level and aspects of their place of residence, among other factors. The data were collected through an anonymous survey administered to a representative sample of Spanish citizens. The methodology used approaches the intangible concept of happiness as resulting from different individual and social causes selected from dimensions addressed in the literature, and calculates their effects or importance through regression coefficients. One of the findings is that people with the highest level of well-being or quality of life in the most important dimensions mostly claim to be happy. With respect to gender, it has a significant influence on the dimensions included in the model of citizen happiness and on personal issues. It is also shown that the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic negatively influenced the quality of life of Spanish citizens and therefore their happiness.",

Indeed, the current exit strategy involving the spreading of vaccines must be combined with progress in effective treatment development. This scenario is sadly supported by the vaccine's immune activation time and the inequalities in the global immunization schedule. Bringing the crises under control means providing the world population with accessible and impactful new therapeutics. We screened a natural product library that contains a unique collection of 2370 natural products into the binding site of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) main protease (Mpro). According to the docking score and to the interaction at the active site, three phenylethanoid glycosides (forsythiaside A, isoacteoside, and verbascoside) were selected. In order to provide better insight into the atomistic interaction and test the impact of the three selected compounds at the binding site, we resorted to a half microsecond-long molecular dynamics simulation. As a result, we are showing that forsythiaside A is the most stable molecule and it is likely to possess the highest inhibitory effect against SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. Phenylethanoid glycosides also have been reported to have both protease and kinase activity.

Modifying workplace environments has been recognized to be important for reducing salt intake. However, studies examining the effects of improving the workplace environment regarding salt reduction are limited. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of workplace dietary intervention on employees' salt intake and sodium-to-potassium (Na/K) ratio.METHODS: A quasi-experimental study was conducted. Two small business establishments in Saitama Prefecture, Japan, were allocated as the intervention (n�=�69) and comparison (n�=�68) workplaces, respectively. The 1-year intervention involving healthy lunch and nutrition education was implemented in the intervention workplace. Spot urine samples, physical assessments, and self-administered questionnaire data were collected at baseline, 6�months, and 1�year after the start of the intervention. Analysis of covariance was conducted to investigate differences in the salt intake or Na/K ratio between the study workplaces at year 1. Educational status and rotating work schedules were included as covariates.RESULTS: Salt intake in the intervention workplace decreased significantly from 10.7 to 9.3�g (-1.4�g change; 95% confidence interval [CI]: \"-2.4, -0.5\"). The adjusted difference in changes in salt intake between workplaces was statistically significant (-3.7�g change; 95% CI: \"-5.2, -2.3\"). Although no significant change was observed in the Na/K ratio in the intervention workplace (3.37-3.08; -0.29 change; 95% CI: \"-0.59, 0.01\"), the adjusted difference in changes between the workplaces was statistically significant (-0.60 change; 95% CI: \"-1.03, -0.17\").CONCLUSIONS: Providing healthy lunch and nutrition education may be effective approaches to reduce employees' salt intake and Na/K ratio.",

Here, we derive airway organoids from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSC-AOs). The hPSC-AOs, particularly ciliated-like cells, are permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Using this platform, we perform a high content screen and identify GW6471, which blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection. GW6471 can also block infection of the B.1.351 SARS-CoV-2 variant. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis suggests that GW6471 blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection at least in part by inhibiting hypoxia inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF1�), which is further validated by chemical inhibitor and genetic perturbation targeting HIF1�. Metabolic profiling identifies decreased rates of glycolysis upon GW6471 treatment, consistent with transcriptome profiling. Finally, xanthohumol, 5-(tetradecyloxy)-2-furoic acid, and ND-646, three compounds that suppress fatty acid biosynthesis, also block SARS-CoV-2 infection. Together, a high content screen coupled with transcriptome and metabolic profiling reveals a key role of the HIF1�-glycolysis axis in mediating SARS-CoV-2 infection of human airway epithelium.",

Parameters were measured on ultrasound biomicroscopy images, including pupil diameter, lens vault (LV), anterior chamber depth, anterior chamber width, iris area, iris thickness (IT 750 and 2000), angle-opening distance (AOD 500 and 750), trabecular-iris space area (TISA 500 and 750), trabecular iris angle (TIA 500 and 750), trabecular-ciliary angle, and ciliary process area. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the most important parameters associated with F-APAC compared with F-CPACG.Results: Fifty-five patients with APAC and 55 patients with CPACG were examined. The anterior chamber depth, IT 750, AOD 750, trabecular iris angle 750, and trabecular-ciliary angle were smaller, and LV and ciliary process area were greater in F-APAC as compared with F-CPACG (P ? 0.01). Multivariate logistic regression showed that thinner IT 750, smaller AOD 750, and larger LV were significantly associated with F-APAC (P < 0.01). IT 750 (area under the curve, 0.703) performed relatively better than AOD 750 (area under the curve, 0.696) in distinguishing F-APAC from F-CPACG, with the best cutoff of 0.404 mm and 0.126 mm, respectively.Conclusions: Compared with F-CPACG, F-APAC had thinner peripheral iris, narrower anterior chamber angle, shallower anterior chamber depth, greater LV, larger and anteriorly positioned ciliary body. IT 750, AOD 750, and LV played important roles in distinguishing eyes predisposed to APAC or CPAC.",

Although the effects of these inductive molecules on lens cell behavior (proliferation, survival, and fiber differentiation) are well-characterized, the precise mechanisms underlying the regulation of growth factor-mediated signaling in lens remains elusive. Increasing evidence highlights the importance of heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) for the signaling regulation of growth factors; however, the identity of the different lens HSPGs and the specific roles they play in lens biology are still unknown.Methods: Semiquantitative real-time (RT)-PCR and immunolabeling were used to characterize the spatial distribution of all known HSPG core proteins and their associated glycosaminoglycans (heparan and chondroitin sulfate) in the postnatal rat lens. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2-treated lens epithelial explants, cultured in the presence of Surfen (an inhibitor of heparan sulfate [HS]-growth factor binding interactions) were used to investigate the requirement for HS in FGF-2-induced proliferation, fiber differentiation, and ERK1/2-signaling.Results: The lens expresses all HSPGs. These HSPGs are differentially localized to distinct functional regions of the lens. In vitro, inhibition of HS-sulfation with Surfen blocked FGF-2-mediated ERK1/2-signaling associated with lens epithelial cell proliferation and fiber differentiation, highlighting that these cellular processes are dependent on HS.Conclusions: These findings support a requirement for HSPGs in FGF-2 driven lens cell proliferation and fiber differentiation. The identification of specific HSPG core proteins in key functional lens regions, and the divergent expression patterns of closely related HSPGs, suggests that different HSPGs may differentially regulate growth factor signaling networks leading to specific biological events involved in lens growth and maintenance.",

Retinal radial peripapillary capillary (RPC) perfusion was measured by OCTA before and after inhaling oxygen in all participants. Systemic hemodynamic variables were also examined and recorded before and after hyperoxia.Results: Hyperoxia significantly reduced the perfused vessel density (PVD) of RPCs in both healthy controls (baseline and hyperoxia: 54.2 � 4.1 and 51.0 � 4.4, respectively, P < 0.001) and patients with POAG (baseline and hyperoxia: 44.7 � 6.1 and 43.2 � 5.4, respectively, P = 0.001). However, the changes in peripapillary PVD between the two gas conditions in patients with POAG were significantly lower than in healthy controls, including both the absolute change (baseline-hyperoxia: 1.5 � 2.0 and 3.2 � 1.2, respectively, P = 0.006) and relative change (ratio of absolute change and baseline value: 3.0% � 4.6% and 6.0% � 2.4%, respectively, P = 0.04).Conclusions: Retinal microvasculature responds to hyperoxia by reducing RPC perfusion in both healthy participants and patients with POAG.

Maternal and neonatal systemic immune responses were investigated by detecting spike-specific antibodies in serum, and the mucosal immune response was assessed by measuring specific antibodies in maternal breastmilk and infant saliva 48 hours after delivery and 2 months later.Exposures: Maternal infection with SARS-CoV-2 in late pregnancy.Main Outcomes and Measures: The systemic immune response was evaluated by the detection of SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgA antibodies and receptor binding domain-specific IgM antibodies in maternal and neonatal serum. The mucosal immune response was assessed by measuring spike-specific antibodies in breastmilk and in infant saliva, and the presence of antigen-antibody spike IgA immune complexes was investigated in breastmilk samples. All antibodies were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.Results: In total, 28 mother-infant dyads (mean [SD] maternal age, 31.8 [6.4] years; mean [SD] gestational age, 38.1 [2.3] weeks; 18 [60%] male infants) were enrolled at delivery, and 21 dyads completed the study at 2 months' follow-up. Because maternal infection was recent in all cases, transplacental transfer of virus spike-specific IgG antibodies occurred in only 1 infant. One case of potential vertical transmission and 1 case of horizontal infection were observed. Virus spike protein-specific salivary IgA antibodies were significantly increased (P = .01) in infants fed breastmilk (0.99 arbitrary units [AU]; IQR, 0.39-1.68 AU) vs infants fed an exclusive formula diet (0.16 AU; IQR, 0.02-0.83 AU). Maternal milk contained IgA spike immune complexes at 48 hours (0.53 AU; IQR, 0.25-0.39 AU) and at 2 months (0.09 AU; IQR, 0.03-0.17 AU) and may have functioned as specific stimuli for the infant mucosal immune response.Conclusions and Relevance: In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 spike-specific IgA antibodies were detected in infant saliva, which may partly explain why newborns are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Mothers infected in the peripartum period appear to not only passively protect the newborn via breastmilk secretory IgA but also actively stimulate and train the neonatal immune system via breastmilk immune complexes.",

This potentially affects their attitudes toward receiving COVID-19 vaccines.Objective: To assess veterans' attitudes toward and intentions to receive COVID-19 vaccines.Design, Setting, and Participants: This cross-sectional web-based survey study used data from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) Survey of Healthcare Experiences of Patients' Veterans Insight Panel, fielded between March 12 and 28, 2021. Of 3420 veterans who were sent a link to complete a 58-item web-based survey, 1178 veterans (34%) completed the survey. Data were analyzed from April 1 to August 25, 2021.Exposures: Veterans eligible for COVID-19 vaccines.Main Outcomes and Measures: The outcomes of interest were veterans' experiences with COVID-19, vaccination status and intention groups, reasons for receiving or not receiving a vaccine, self-reported health status, and trusted and preferred sources of information about COVID-19 vaccines. Reasons for not getting vaccinated were classified into categories of vaccine deliberation, dissent, distrust, indifference, skepticism, and policy and processes.Results: Among 1178 respondents, 974 (83%) were men, 130 (11%) were women, and 141 (12%) were transgender or nonbinary; 58 respondents (5%) were Black, 54 veterans (5%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 987 veterans (84%) were non-Hispanic White. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 66.7 (10.1) years. A total of 817 respondents (71%) self-reported being vaccinated against COVID-19. Of 339 respondents (29%) who were not vaccinated, those unsure of getting vaccinated were more likely to report fair or poor overall health (32 respondents [43%]) and mental health (33 respondents [44%]) than other nonvaccinated groups (overall health: range, 20%-32%; mental health: range, 18%-40%). Top reasons for not being vaccinated were skepticism (120 respondents [36%] were concerned about side effects; 65 respondents [20%] preferred using few medications; 63 respondents [19%] preferred gaining natural immunity), deliberation (74 respondents [22%] preferred to wait because vaccine is new), and distrust (61 respondents [18%] did not trust the health care system). Among respondents who were vaccinated, preventing oneself from getting sick (462 respondents [57%]) and contributing to the end of the COVID-19 pandemic (453 respondents [56%]) were top reasons for getting vaccinated. All veterans reported the VA as 1 of their top trusted sources of information. The proportion of respondents trusting their VA health care practitioner as a source of vaccine information was higher among those unsure about vaccination compared with those who indicated they would definitely not or probably not get vaccinated (18 respondents [26%] vs 15 respondents [15%]). There were no significant associations between vaccine intention groups and age (�24 = 5.90; P = .21) or gender (�22 = 3.99; P = .14).Conclusions and Relevance: These findings provide information needed to develop trusted messages used in conversations between VA health care practitioners and veterans addressing specific vaccine hesitancy reasons, as well as those in worse health. Conversations need to emphasize societal reasons for getting vaccinated and benefits to one's own health.",

A qualitative phenomenological approach was adopted using a purposive convenience sample of 10 district nursing students. Data were collected during online focus group interviews and analysed using a thematic framework. Four themes emerged: referral criteria; insight and inconsistency; task versus patient-centred care; and misunderstanding the service and referral quality. The themes reflect a lack of consensus with respect to referral criteria, contributing to inappropriate and poor-quality referrals.

This study aimed to examine knowledge and attitudes around sexual health and contraceptive use amongst this vulnerable group to develop suitable models of care in the community. A qualitative ethnographic case-study following Burawoy's extended case method was used. Semi-structured interviews with 29 young people experiencing homelessness and five key workers in London hostels were carried out together with ethnographic observations and analysis of documentary evidence. Thematic analysis was undertaken. Demographic data were collected. Three significant themes were identified: risks and extreme vulnerability, relationships and communication difficulties and emergence of a culture of homelessness. Young people experiencing homelessness require specialist delivery of sexual health care in safe surroundings. Initial care should focus on assessment of basic needs and current state of being. Establishing trusting relationships and considering ongoing vulnerability, can help promote meaningful and personalised sexual healthcare both at policy and practice level.",

This ethnographic study involved two research methods: interviews with patients and nurses (n=22) and observations of clinical interactions (n=62). Dignity can manifest during routine interactions between community nurses and patients. Patient-participants identified malodour from their ill-bodies as a particular threat to dignity. Nurses can reinforce the dignity of their patients through relational aspects of care and the successful concealment of 'leaky' bodies.",

Here we investigate the attachment of aquatic insect larvae (Blephariceridae), which cling to rocks in torrential streams using the only known muscle-actuated suction organs in insects. We measured their attachment forces on well-defined rough substrates and found that their adhesion was less reduced by micro-roughness than that of terrestrial climbing insects. In vivo visualisation of the suction organs in contact with microstructured substrates revealed that they can mould around large asperities to form a seal. We have shown that the ventral surface of the suction disc is covered by dense arrays of microtrichia, which are stiff spine-like cuticular structures that only make tip contact. Our results demonstrate the impressive performance and versatility of blepharicerid suction organs and highlight their potential as a study system to explore biological suction mechanisms.",

This study aimed to investigate the potential molecular targets and mechanisms of LHQW in treating COVID-19 using a network pharmacology-based approach and molecular docking analysis. The main active ingredients, therapeutic targets of LHQW, and the pathogenic targets of COVID-19 were screened using the TCMSP, UniProt, STRING, and GeneCards databases. According to the \"Drug-Ingredients-Targets-Disease\" network, Interleukin 6 (IL6) was identified as the core target, and quercetin, luteolin, and wogonin as the active ingredients of LHQW associated with IL6. The response to lipopolysaccharide was the most significant biological process identified by gene ontology enrichment analysis, and AGE-RAGE signaling pathway activation was prominent based on the interaction between LHQW and COVID-19. Protein-protein docking analysis showed that IL6 receptor (IL6R)/IL6/IL6 receptor subunit beta (IL6ST) and Spike protein were mainly bound via conventional hydrogen bonds. Furthermore, protein-small molecule docking showed that all three active ingredients could bind stably in the binding model of IL6R/IL6 and IL6ST. Our findings suggest that LHQW may inhibit the lipopolysaccharide-mediated inflammatory response and regulate the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway through IL6. In addition, the N-terminal domain of the S protein of COVID-19 has a good binding activity to IL6ST, and quercetin and wogonin in LHQW may affect IL6ST-mediated IL6 signal transduction and a large number of signaling pathways downstream to other cytokines by directly affecting protein-protein interaction. These findings suggest the potential molecular mechanism by which LHQW inhibits COVID-19 through the regulation of IL6R/IL6/IL6ST.",

We only included studies with full-text and in English and assessed study quality with Newcastle-Ottawa Scale or Cochrane risk-of-bias tool. We recorded details of study design, participants, procedure performed, protocol of follow-up, pain response, quality of life, survival, and adverse events. The study was conducted under Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement 2009.RESULTS: Five studies involving 319 patients were included. Short-term pain response rates ranged from 65.0% to 88.46% in EUS-CGN group and most studies reported its superiority over EUS-CPN. As for adverse events, the incidence of transient hypotension and gastrointestinal symptoms seemed comparable, while results of initial pain exacerbation varied among studies. Besides, EUS-CGN might provide a shorter survival.CONCLUSION: EUS-CGN can be safely performed while it may shorten survival. In terms of short-term pain response, EUS-CGN is better than EUS-CPN while no conclusion of long-term pain control can be drawn.",

Patients with this disease are often accompanied with cognitive impairment. However, the pathogenesis of the cognitive impairment remains unclear. Resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging is a kind of magnetic resonance imaging method based on blood oxygen level dependence. This can reflect the spontaneous brain functional activity of a human brain in the resting state. In recent years, a number of researchers have used resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging to study the changes in resting spontaneous brain function in patients with temporal lobe epilepsy with cognitive impairment (TLE-CI). However, due to the differences in sample and methodology, the results of these studies were inconsistent. Therefore, the present study aimed to investigate the characteristics of the resting spontaneous brain function in patients with TLE-CI through a meta-analysis.METHODS: A search was conducted on electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, WANGFANG DATA and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Baidu scholar Database, from the establishment of the database to April 20, 2021. Randomized controlled trials that employed amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations/regional homogeneity to investigate the changes in resting spontaneous brain function in patients with TLE-CI were selected. Anisotropic effect size version of signed differential mapping was applied to perform the data analysis.RESULTS: The study summarized the changes in spontaneous brain function in patients with TLE-CI.CONCLUSION: The conclusion for the functional cerebral alterations based on the latest studies will be provided.",

Different from other subtypes of PAH, PVOD patients have a very poor prognosis because of the progressive nature of pulmonary vascular involvement and fatal pulmonary edema induced by PAH-targeted drugs. Lung transplantation is the only choice for these patients.PATIENT CONCERNS: We reported 2 cases of PVOD which was misdiagnosed as idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension initially due to the lack of typical findings of PVOD. Right heart catheterization was done. The results showed severe PAH with mean pulmonary artery pressure at 76 mmHg and 68 mmHg.DIAGNOSIS: The diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension was corrected by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 alpha kinase 4 (EIF2AK4) mutation screening. Biallelic mutations (c.1387delT (p. Arg463fs); c.989-990 delAA (p. Lys330fs)) were detected by next-generation sequencing for whole exome from blood sample. The presence of biallelic EIF2AK4 mutation was sufficient to confirm the diagnosis of PVOD.INTERVENTIONS: The 2 patients had good response to PAH-targeted therapy (Ambrisentan 10 mg once a day and tadalafil 20 mg once a day) in the following 1 year.OUTCOMES: Because the patients had a good response to targeted drugs, the treatment of the 2 cases was unchanged. Over 1-year period, they still have a good response to PAH-targeted drugs. There was no sign of pulmonary edema.LESSONS: All these results may indicate that PVOD is not so rare and typical findings of PVOD are lacking in some patients. EIF2AK4 mutation screening by next-generation sequencing maybe useful to differentiate PVOD from other PAH subtypes. PVOD is a heterogeneity population and different patients have different characteristics including response to PAH-targeted therapy. How to pick off this portion of patients timely is the core issue. Further study is necessary to answer this question.",

Cox regression analysis was used to identify independent prognostic factors in patients. Subgroup analysis stratified by T stage and N stage was performed. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed to assess disease specific survival (DSS).A total of 1160 patients were retrieved, of whom 289 (24.9%) underwent PRT plus chemotherapy, and 871 (75.1%) did not receive PRT. In multivariate analysis, PRT plus chemotherapy was a favorable prognostic factor for patients with stage T2 (hazard ratio [HR], 0.364, 95% CI, 0.202-0.658; P < .001), T3 (HR, 0.536, 95% CI, 0.413-0.695; P < .001) and T4 (HR, 0.318, 95% CI, 0.125-0.805; P = .016), but PRT plus chemotherapy was not statistically significant on DSS in patients with T1 disease (HR, 0.556, 95% CI, 0.262-1.179; P = .126). All 3 different N stages (N0, N1, and N2 + N3) were statistically significant (P < .05) in chemotherapy with or without PRT.In conclusion, patients with stage II and III ESCC at the T2-T4 stage gained significant survival benefit from PRT plus chemotherapy.",

There are many current treatment options with varying efficacy, and to assess their effectiveness, we performed a network meta-analysis (NMA). The study protocol was registered at PROSPERO (CRD: 42019119178). Posted history: this manuscript was previously posted to medRxiv: doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.06.03.20121780.METHODS: The literature search database includes Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane library that meets the requirements. We performed the NMA using controlled trials with 2 kinds of outcomes. We used the gemtc R package to perform the NMA to evaluate different GBS treatments' relative results. The consistency of direct and indirect evidence was also assessed by R software with gemtc package.RESULTS: This NMA study included a total of 2474 subjects from 28 trials with 15 kinds of therapies. No improvement was observed in methylprednisolone and prednisolone compared with placebo. Conversely, plasma exchange (PE) and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) were more effective than placebo. There was no significant difference between different doses and courses of PE and IVIg. For combination treatment, such as IVIg+eculizumab, immunoadsorption followed by IVIg and PE followed by IVIg, they didn't show significant advantages than IVIg and PE in NMA. On the consistency examination between direct and indirect evidence, there was no apparent heterogeneity between them. Funnel plots indicated there was little possibility of publication bias in this study.CONCLUSION: PE or IVIg has significant efficacy for GBS patients. The effects of several kinds of therapies should be further explored. Corticosteroids have no considerable impact on GBS.",

Neurological symptoms may develop in patients with GCT of the spine, and surgical treatment is prioritized in cases where resection is possible. However, the local recurrence rate of GCT of the bone is higher than that of GCT at other sites owing to the associated surgical challenges, and treatment is often difficult. No study to date has reported long-term remission of recurrent tumors for more than 5 years by treatment with carbon ion beam radiotherapy after resection of GCT of the cervical spine.PATIENT CONCERNS: A 14-year-old boy who experienced recurrence after surgery for GCT of the cervical spine.DIAGNOSIS: The patient presented with cervical pain, and computed tomography revealed a mass of the C2 vertebral body. He underwent surgery for tumor resection and autologous bone grafting, and the final pathological diagnosis was GCT. The transplanted bone exhibited gradual progression of resorption, and recurrent tumors were observed on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging 1 year and 4 months after surgery.INTERVENTIONS: The patient was started on denosumab at 15 years of age and received carbon ion beam therapy with 70.4 Gy administered in 32 sessions over 7 weeks.OUTCOMES: No progressive tumor growth was observed, there were no neurological symptoms such as paralysis or pain were noted, and the patient was in remission for 5 years after irradiation.CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that carbon ion radiotherapy is a safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with recurrent GCT of the cervical spine.",

Traditional Chinese medicine injection (TCMJ) has been widely used as a promising adjuvant drug in the treatment of ovarian carcinoma. However, the exact clinical efficacy and safety of TCMJ have not been well studied due to the wide variety. This study aims to conduct a network meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) about comparing the effect of TCMJ combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on the treatment of ovarian cancer, thus summarizing the effects of TCMJ on the prognosis, quality of life and immune function of ovarian carcinoma patients, and providing a reference for developing therapeutic regimens for ovarian carcinoma.METHODS: Randomized controlled trials reporting the effect of TCMJ combined with chemotherapy and chemotherapy alone on the prognosis, quality of life and immune function in patients with ovarian carcinoma published before September 2021 will be screened out from online databases like PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Embase, China Scientific Journal Database, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and Wanfang Database. Subsequently, 2 researchers will be independently responsible for literature screening, data extraction and assessment of their quality. All data will be processed by R.4.1.0.RESULTS: The results of this meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication.CONCLUSIONS: Evidence-based medicine supports the efficacy and safety of TCMJ combined with chemotherapy for the treatment of ovarian carcinoma, which is better than that of chemotherapy alone.ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was not required for this study.

Many medical groups across the United States have experienced extraordinary clinical and financial pressures due to COVID-19 as a result of a decline in elective inpatient and outpatient surgical procedures and most nonurgent elective physician visits. The current study reports how our medical group in a metropolitan community in Kentucky rebooted our ambulatory and inpatient services following the guidance of our state's phased reopening. Particular attention focused on the transition between the initial COVID-19 surge and post-COVID-19 surge and how our medical group responded to meet community needs. Ten strategies were incorporated in our medical group, including heightened communication; ambulatory telehealth; safe and clean outpatient environment; marketing; physician, other medical provider, and staff compensation; high quality patient experience; schedule optimization; rescheduling tactics; data management; and primary care versus specialty approaches. These methods are applicable to both the current rebooting stage as well as to a potential resurgence of COVID-19 in the future.",

Among all 109 patients with MODS, 81.7% were over 60 years old, and 63.3% were male. The most common symptoms were fever (79.8%), dyspnea (73.4%), and fatigue (55.0%). Compared with patients non-MODS patients, there were 70 cases of MODS patients with one or more underlying diseases (64.2% vs 41.0%, P < .001). Respiratory failure (92.7%), circulatory failure (52.0%), and liver function injury (30.9%) were the most common symptoms within the spectrum of MODS. Invasive ventilator, noninvasive ventilator, and high-flow respiratory support treatment for patients in MODS patients were higher than those in the non-MODS group (P < .001). The antiviral therapy and 2 or more antibacterial drug treatments in MODS patients were higher than those in the non-MODS group (P < .001). The median hospital stay of all patients was 16 days (interquartile range [IQR], 9-26), of which 20 days (IQR, 11.5-30.5) in the MODS patients, which was approximately 4 days longer than that of non-MODS patients. In addition, our data suggested that lymphocyte counts <1.0 ? 109/L, Troponin T > 0.014 ng/mL and lower oxygenation index were risk factors for MODS. In the early stage of hospital admission, higher inflammatory indexes and lactic acid concentration were associated with increased risk of death.MODS often leads to poor prognosis in coronavirus disease 2019. Our data suggested the importance of early identification of MODS. We recommend close monitoring and timely supportive therapy for patients with high risks, stopping the disease progression before it was too late.",

However, screening programs and intense treatment are expensive and require good health care systems. For CRC, no clear association has yet been established between clinical outcomes and health care disparities.METHOD: We used the mortality-to-incidence ratio (MIR) of CRC as a measure of clinical outcomes for comparison with the Human Development Index (HDI), current health expenditure (CHE), and current health expenditure as a percentage of gross domestic product (CHE/GDP) using linear regression analyses. We included 171 countries based on data from the GLOBOCAN 2018 database.RESULTS: We found that the regions with the lowest MIRs for CRC are Oceania and North America. A significant correlation was observed between incidence, mortality and HDI, CHE, and CHE/GDP among the countries enrolled. Furthermore, lower MIRs of CRC significantly correlated with higher HDI, CHE, and CHE/GDP (P < 0.001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.001, respectively).CONCLUSION: : CRC MIRs tend to be most favorable in countries with high health care expenditures and a high HDI.",

However, the results are still controversial. We aimed to clarify the association of GAS5 rs145204276 polymorphism with cancer risk by meta-analysis.METHODS: PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang, and Cochrane Library were searched for studies concerning GAS5 and cancer published up to November 25, 2019. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to evaluate cancer risk.RESULTS: A total of 12 case-control studies with 8729 cases and 10,807 controls were included in this meta-analysis. We found that the GAS5 rs145204276 polymorphism was not significantly associated with cancer risk (Del vs Ins: OR = 0.96, 95% CI: 0.81-1.13; Del/Del vs Ins/Ins: OR = 1.00, 95% CI: 0.70-1.43; Ins/Del vs Ins/Ins: OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.78-1.08; Ins/Del and Del/Del vs Ins/Ins: OR = 0.93, 95% CI: 0.76-1.13; Del/Del vs Ins/Del and Ins/Ins: OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.78-1.38).

Health care providers were forced to focus mainly on COVID-19 patients, neglecting in many cases equally important diseases, both acute and chronic. Therefore, also screening and diagnostic strategies for HIV could have been significantly impaired.This retrospective, multicenter, observational study aimed at assessing the number and characteristics of new HIV/AIDS diagnoses during COVID-19 pandemic in Italy and compared characteristics of people living with HIV at diagnosis between pre- and post-COVID-19 era (2019 vs 2020).Our results showed a significant reduction of HIV diagnoses during pandemic. By contrast, people living with HIV during pandemic were older and were diagnosed in earlier stage of disease (considering CD4+ T cell count) compared to those who were diagnosed the year before. Moreover, there was a significant decrease of new HIV diagnoses among men who have sex with men, probably for the impact of social distancing and restriction applied by the Italian Government. Late presentation incidence, if numbers in 2020 were lower than those in 2019, is still an issue.Routinely performing HIV testing in patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection is identifying and linking to care underdiagnosed people living with HIV earlier. Thus, combined tests (HIV and SARS-CoV-2) should be implemented in patients with SARS-CoV-2 symptoms overlapping HIV's ones. Lastly, our results lastly showed how urgent implementation of a national policy for HIV screening is necessary.",

We hypothesized that functional outcomes would be equivalent between treatment types, reduction approaches, and fixation types. Our purpose was to assess patient-reported outcomes and complications by treatment type (operative versus nonoperative), reduction approach (open versus percutaneous), and fixation type (cannulated screws versus Kirschner wires).We retrospectively reviewed data from acute lateral humeral condyle fractures treated at our level-1 pediatric trauma center from 2008 to 2017. Patients were included if they were 8 years or older and had completed clinical follow-up. Fractures were categorized by fracture severity as mild (<2-mm displacement), moderate (isolated, 2- to 5-mm displacement), or severe (isolated, >5-mm displacement or >2-mm displacement with concomitant elbow dislocation or other elbow fracture). We extracted data on patient age, sex, treatment type, reduction approach, fixation type, patient-reported outcomes (shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand and Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System upper extremity), treatment complications, and follow-up duration. Patients in the operative versus nonoperative group and across fracture severity subgroups did not differ significantly by age, sex, or follow-up duration. Bivariate analysis was performed to determine whether outcomes differed by intervention. Alpha = 0.05.No differences were observed in patient-reported outcomes between operative versus nonoperative groups for the mild and severe fracture subgroups. No differences were observed between approach (open versus percutaneous) or instrumentation (cannulated screw versus Kirschner wire fixation) for any outcome measure within the operative group. Patients whose fractures were stabilized with screws versus wires had significantly higher rates of return to the operating room (94% versus 8.3%, P < .001). The overall complication rate for our cohort was low, with no differences by treatment type or fracture severity.In our cohort, patient-reported outcomes were similar across fracture severity categories, irrespective of treatment or fixation type. Patients who underwent internal fixation with cannulated screws experienced significantly higher rates of return to the operating room compared with those treated with Kirschner wires but otherwise had similar complication rates and patient-reported outcomes.Level of Evidence: 3.",

Vitamin E-infused highly cross-linked polyethylene is theoretically known to prevent failure due to oxidative degradation in the body, and is resistant to wear; therefore, successful long-term survival of THA is expected.PATIENT CONCERNS: In June 2019, approximately 1.5 years after THA, the patient sat down and stood up without any specific issue; however, an unusual bullet sound occurred around the left hip joint. Since then, his discomfort persisted, and he was admitted to the emergency department.DIAGNOSIS: Plain radiography and metal artifact reduction computed tomography performed in the emergency department revealed eccentric elevation of the prosthetic femoral head and suspected PE liner failure.INTERVENTION: Revision surgery was performed for modular component exchange. To reduce the dislocation risk without performing cup exchange, conversion to dual-mobility articulation was performed.OUTCOMES: During the regular follow-up post-surgery, the patient could perform daily life activities without any discomfort, and dislocation was not observed. At 2 years postoperatively, no significant changes were observed in the radiographic images.LESSONS: This case report presents an unexpected failure of THA due to superior rim fracture and excessive wear at the locking mechanism of the vitamin E-infused highly cross-linked polyethylene liner. This is an interesting case, as early PE liner failure occurred without strong labor intensity or trauma. A modular component exchange was performed with a dual-mobility bearing, and no issues were observed approximately 2 years after the reoperation. Therefore, third-generation highly cross-linked polyethylene liners can also cause early failure without a clear cause, and this case report highlights the necessity of considering several strategies for reoperation.STUDY DESIGN: Case report.",

Women aged 21 to 65 years in the United States (U.S.) have not reached the Healthy People 2020 objective of 93% for cervical cancer screening. The main aim of this study was to investigate the association between HPV vaccination status and cervical cancer screening among privately insured women aged 21 to 26 years in the U.S.This was a retrospective cohort study using the IBM MarketScan database (2006-2016). The study population included 190,982 HPV-vaccinated women and 763,928 matched unvaccinated women. Adjusted incidence rate ratio (IRR) and the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were obtained using the generalized estimating equations models with a Poisson distribution.Among a total of 954,910 women included in the analysis, age (mean [SD]) was 23.3 [1.6] years. During 967,317 person-years of follow-up, a total of 475,702 incidents of cervical cancer screening were identified. The incidence density rates of cervical cancer screening were 461 per 1000 person-years (PY) for unvaccinated women and 787 per 1000 PY for those who received 3 doses of the HPV vaccine. After adjusting for other covariates, the IRR of cervical cancer screening was 34% higher among HPV-vaccinated women with at least one vaccine dose than unvaccinated women (adjusted IRR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.33-1.35; P < .0001). The IRR of cervical cancer screening varied by the dose of HPV vaccination. There was evidence of a linear dose-response relationship between the number of HPV vaccine doses and cervical cancer screening (P-trend < .0001). Compared with unvaccinated women, the IRR of cervical cancer screening were 14%, 39%, and 60% higher among those who received 1, 2, and 3 doses of the HPV vaccine, respectively.In this large retrospective cohort study of privately insured women, HPV-vaccinated women were more likely to be screened for cervical cancer compared with unvaccinated women.",

The patients who were not citizens of the Republic of Turkey were not included in the study.It was observed that analyses for at least 1 c-kit exon mutation had been carried out on 76 patients, which detected no c-kit mutation among the types of genetic mutations investigated in all of those 76 patients. We found the frequency of FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3-internal tandem duplication mutation as 25%. The prevalence of translocation(15;17) was approximately 11% and the prevalence of translocation(8;21) was % 6.25. In addition, we also showed that the frequency of inversion16 was nearly 3.7%.Lastly, the possibility of c-kit mutation in AML patients from Turkey might actually be low.",

These studies included 1630 patients and 836 controls published between 1990 and 2017. The methods used in BA assays varied significantly, and the studies did not agree. on specific individual BA or BA ratios as biomarkers of specific liver injury or dysfunction. Except for the prognostic value of BA in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP), studies have failed to provide evidence for BA as a liver biomarker.CONCLUSIONS: Despite the research conducted on BA for over 27 years, there are inconsistencies in the reported results and a lack of solid evidence to support the use of individual BA or BA ratios as biomarkers of liver injury.

The use of movement sensors with alarms has been studied as elements with predictive capacity for falls at hospital level. However, in spite of their use in some hospitals throughout the world, evidence is lacking about their effectiveness in reducing intra-hospital falls. Therefore, this study aims to develop a systematic review and meta-analysis of existing scientific literature exploring the impact of using sensors for fall prevention in hospitalized adults and the elderly population.METHODS: We explored literature based on clinical trials in Spanish, English, and Portuguese, assessing the impact of devices used for hospital fall prevention in adult and elderly populations. The search included databases such as IEEE Xplore, the Cochrane Library, Scopus, PubMed, MEDLINE, and Science Direct databases. The critical appraisal was performed independently by two researchers. Methodological quality was assessed based on the ratings of individual biases. We performed the sum of the results, generating an estimation of the grouped effect (Relative Risk, 95% CI) for the outcome first fall for each patient. We assessed heterogeneity and publication bias. The study followed PRISMA guidelines.RESULTS: Results were assessed in three randomized controlled clinical trials, including 29,691 patients. A total of 351 (3%) patients fell among 11,769 patients assigned to the intervention group, compared with 426 (2.4%) patients who fell among 17,922 patients assigned to the control group (general estimation RR 1.20, 95% CI 1.04, 1.37, P = .02, I2 = 0%; Moderate GRADE).CONCLUSION: Our results show an increase of 19% in falls among elderly patients who are users of sensors located in their bed, bed-chair, or chair among their hospitalizations. Other types of sensors such as wearable sensors can be explored as coadjutants for fall prevention care in hospitals.",

GDM mothers are susceptible to stress due to insulin resistance, and their level of stress is associated with breastfeeding. This study aimed to identify patterns of stress change over time in GDM mothers and healthy mothers and to identify the factors influencing those patterns.The participants of this study were mothers within 14 days after childbirth. The GDM group consisted of 32 mothers, and the healthy group comprised 30 mothers. Cumulative stress was measured in terms of heart rate variability, and linear mixed models were used to analyze changes over time.The cumulative stress of healthy mothers was about 8 points higher than that of mothers with GDM (t = -2.95, P = .005). The cumulative stress level was inversely associated with the mother's age (�=-1.20, P = .018), the mother's weight (�=-0.64, P = .008), and the baby's body mass index (�=-3.09, P = .038). Furthermore, an insufficient amount of breast milk was associated with higher stress (�=16.09, P = .007).GDM mothers and healthy mothers experienced different patterns of cumulative stress. Breastfeeding should be started quickly to promote health and stress reduction among mothers who are physically and psychologically vulnerable after childbirth.It is necessary to incorporate programs to promote breastfeeding considering stress levels at an appropriate time according to the mother's health condition.",

The performance of an AI-based software assessment tool for detection of COVID-associated abnormalities was compared with human evaluation based on COVID-19 reporting and data system (CO-RADS) scores performed by 3 readers.All evaluated variables of the AI-based assessment showed significant differences between the 2 groups (P < .01). The inter-reader reliability of CO-RADS scoring was 0.87. The CO-RADS scores were substantially higher in group A (mean 4.28) than group B (mean 1.50). The difference between CO-RADS scoring and AI assessment was statistically significant for all variables but showed good correlation with the clinical context of the CO-RADS score. AI allowed to predict COVID positive cases with an accuracy of 0.94.The evaluated AI-based algorithm detects COVID-19-associated findings with high sensitivity and may support radiologic workflows during the pandemic.",

A self-administered questionnaire was collected between 27/11/2020 to 7/12/2020. The questionnaire consists of socio-demographics, knowledge, and practice in regard to coronavirus, attitude toward vaccinations, coronavirus vaccine acceptance, and reasons for hesitancy.RESULTS: Out of 468 nurses, 334 nurses completed the survey. Overall, (236) 70.7% of nurses were willing to uptake coronavirus vaccine, which is a relatively high acceptance rate. 78.7% believe that COVID-19 vaccination should be mandatory once available. The main four reasons for hesitancy were the lack of knowledge 23.1%, long term adverse effects 17.7%, short-term side effects of the vaccine 9.3%, non-effective vaccine 8.7%.CONCLUSIONS: The findings presented in this study can help Saudi Arabian health authorities to tailor educational campaigns for nurses and development of effective vaccination programs to increase the novel vaccine acceptance and uptake among nurses' population.",

Moreover, RSVs using synonyms of \"Taste\" and \"Smell\" in 5 European languages were analyzed.RESULTS: The worldwide mean RSVs for \"Fever\", \"Cough\", \"Smell\", and \"Taste\" during 2020 were 49%, 34%, 8% and 9%, respectively. RSVs associated with the search terms \"Fever\" and \"Cough\" showed a peak between February and March 2020, as did \"Smell\" and \"Taste\". Even though RSVs were much lower, they were highly correlated (r=0.890). RSVs obtained from \"Smell\" and \"Taste\" in five European languages (German, English, French, Italian and Spanish) had similar temporal trends.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show the level of the general population's interest for early symptoms, suggesting that their interest in SARS-CoV-2 infection symptoms, such as SD and TD, was scarce but peaked during the pandemic outbreak.",

To improve current management, it is essential to find the hub genes and pathways associated with different COVID-19 subtypes.MATERIALS AND METHODS: The whole-genome sequencing information (GSE156063, GSE163151) of nasopharyngeal swabs from normal subjects and COVID-19 patients were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The molecular subtypes of patients with COVID-19 were classified using the \"consistent clustering\" method, and the specific genes associated with each subtype were found. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened between normal subjects and COVID-19 patients; the Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) method was used to find the key module genes of COVID-19 patients. Subtype-specific, differentially expressed and module-related genes were collected and intersected. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analysis were carried out and protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were generated. The pathways enriched in COVID-19 subtypes were analyzed by gene set variation analysis (GSVA).RESULTS: Patients with COVID-19 were divided into three subtypes, and there was no significant difference in gender and age distribution between subtypes. 82 differential gene pathways were screened between Subtypes I and II, 131 differential gene pathways were screened between Subtypes I and III, and 107 differential gene pathways were screened between Subtypes II and III. Finally, 44 differentially expressed key genes were screened, including 11 hub genes (RSAD2, IFIT1, MX1, OAS1, OAS2, BST2, IFI27, IFI35, IFI6, IFITM3, STAT2).CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in gene activation and pathway enrichment among different molecular subtypes of COVID-19, which may account for the heterogeneity in clinical presentation and the prognosis of patients.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the homeless population assisted by the primary care services of the Eleemosynaria Apostolica, Vatican City.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Persons experiencing homelessness and the volunteers assisting them were tested for COVID-19 through PCR and antigen rapid test between October 1st, 2020, and June 5th, 2021, in the clinical facilities of the Eleemosynaria Apostolica.RESULTS: A total of 1665 subjects from 96 different countries in five continents were included in the study; age range was 1-90 years. Overall, 2315 COVID-19 tests through nasopharyngeal swab were performed; 1052 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests and 1263 antigen rapid tests. Nearly 40% of the subjects underwent both tests (n=650, 39.04%), 402 were tested with PCR test only (24.14%) and 613 with antigen test only (36.8%). PCR tests were negative in 966 cases and positive in 86 (8.17%), while antigen tests were negative in 1205 cases and positive in 58 (4.59%). The number of positive cases varied over time, with a drastic increase during the winter months of 2020 and a progressive decrease over 2021. Among positive cases, 24.41% were symptomatic; symptoms included fever, breathing difficulties, anosmia/hyposmia, cough, headache, and diarrhea.CONCLUSIONS: This study reported an overall prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our sample slightly above 8%. Additional data on viral genome through sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in positive cases are of utmost importance to help identify variants and implement specific infection control measures.",

In this study, the induction of periodontal disease via retentive ligature, lipopolysaccharide, and their combination at three different times were compared in a rat model. Seventy-two Sprague Dawley rats were distributed into four treatment groups: 1) control group with no treatment; 2) application of 4/0 nylon ligature around second maxillary molars; 3) combination of ligature and LPS injection (ligature-LPS); 4) intragingival injection of Porphyromonas gingivalis lipopolysaccharide (Pg-LPS) to the palatal mucosa of the second maxillary molars. Six rats were sacrificed from each group after 7, 14, and 30 days of periodontal disease induction. Alveolar bone loss, attachment loss, number of inflammatory cells, and blood vessels were evaluated histologically. A micro-CT scan was used as a parameter to know the rate of alveolar bone loss. Parametric data were analyzed using two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni correction with a significance set at 5%. Non-parametric data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis, followed by multiple comparisons with Bonferroni correction. The histological results revealed significant destructive changes in the periodontal tissues and alveolar bone following the ligature and ligature-LPS induction techniques. These changes were evident as early as seven days, maintained until 14 days post-treatment, and declined with time. The ligature technique was effective in inducing acute periodontal disease. The LPS injection technique did not induce alveolar bone loss, and its combination to ligature added insignificant effects.",

The disease was treated with two kinds of eye drops containing 0.1% dexamethasone and 0.75% cyclosporine in combination with 30% DMSO, administered three times a day. Prior to the treatment and after 5 weeks of therapy, depigmentation of the third eyelid margin, corneal neovascularization and pigmentation were assessed. The percentage of the corneal surface afflicted with inflammatory processes was calculated with the use of IsoCalc.com's Get Area software for CorelDRAW12.RESULTS: The administered therapy resulted in a significant decrease in the mean number of quadrants affected by corneal neovascularization in the right eye from 2.63 prior to treatment to 0.24 after treatment (p?0.001), and the left eye from 2.66 to 0.59 (p?0.001), respectively. Mean corneal surface afflicted with inflammatory processes was statistically significantly reduced from 53.5% to 26.3% (p?0.001) in the case of right corneas, and from 54.5% to 30.2% (p?0.001) in the case of left corneas. Of 77 corneas diagnosed with pigmentation, pigmentation reduction was observed in 54 and pigmentation increase in 27.CONCLUSIONS: Using dexamethasone and cyclosporine/DMSO combination eye drops proved to be a viable initial therapy against CSK, which facilitates reduction of inflammatory processes and neovascularization atrophy, but in many cases does not inhibit the progress of pigmentation.",

For each herd, the following fertility parameters were calculated at the start of the program and 4 years later: first- service conception rate, services per conception, length of inter-calving period and culling rate due to infertility. The incidence of silent heat, ovarian cysts, ovarian afunction, retained placenta and clinical endometritis was also recorded. Four years after implementation of the program, the average first-service conception rate increased from 43.2% to 51.2%. In three herds the differences were statistically significant (p?0.05). There was also a decrease in the number of services per pregnancy and in the culling rate due to infertility. Fertility performance was maintained in two herds. The average incidence of silent heat decreased from 38.1% to 29.7% and the difference was statistically significant (p?0.05) in three herds. There was no significant reduction in incidence of other reproductive disorders during the 4 years except for clinical endometritis in one herd. The average milk yield increased from 9300 kg to 9530 kg milk per cow per year. In conclusion, the results indicate that the implementation of the integrated veterinary herd health program improved or maintained fertility performance despite an increase in milk yield.",

Light microscopic observations showed TPPI activity in almost all the LSG structures. The enzyme reaction in different cell types was compared semi-quantitatively. Strong reaction was observed in the small neurons, satellite ganglia cells and some nerve fibers. Weak reactivity was found in the large sensory somatic neurons, whereas moderate reaction for TPPI was determined in the middle sensory somatic neurons and some nerve fibers. Statistical analysis by one-way ANOVA showed no signi?cance of difference (when p?0.05) for the number of TPPI positive neurons per mm2. The original data obtained by the enzyme histochemistry method give us a reason to presume that TPPI actively participates in the functions of all the neuronal structures in porcine LSG.

For this reason, veterinarians face a major obstacle - the veterinary drug market is not very profitable, which sometimes leads to not having a licensed drug available for treatment in veterinary practice. In this case, the cascade procedure allows veterinarians to, under certain circumstances, prescribe human approved drugs. The aim of our study was to analyze the pattern of human approved drugs prescription for 150 medical records of dogs participating in the survey. The results show that antimicrobial agents were the most commonly prescribed drugs for animals (50%) of all human approved drugs, and beta-lactams (38.6%) were the most widely used antibiotic classes. The most common general conditions for therapeutic use of antimicrobials in this study were digestive, skin and respiratory disorders. Our study shows that the frequency of bacterial culture, susceptibility testing and cytology was very low. Even though the off-label use of human approved drugs in animal practice is regulated by law, the results of this study indicate the need for more specific strategies and guidelines for such use. This may represent a potential for improvement by raising veterinarians' awareness toward more prudent use of human drugs.",

CPV has developed several strategies to evade innate immune response mediated by type I interferons (IFN-I) to achieve a successful infection. The aim of this work was to evaluate the capability of CVP-2c to evade the IFN-I mediated response in infected cells. To establish the role of this response, the gene expression of interferon � (IFN�), IFIT1, IFIT3, MAVS, and STING were estimated in MDCK cells infected with CPV-2c. Viral replication and gene expression was evaluated by quantitative PCR, also, a treatment with IFN-I (interferon omega) was included to confirm the role of IFN-I during CPV infection. The results revealed that CPV-2c infection stimulates the expression of IFN� moderately, in these cells. Due to low IFN� induction, the IFIT1 and IFIT3 expression were also low, and therefore CPV-2c was able to replicate in these cells. However, when the cells were treated with exogenous IFN-I, the IFN� expression was higher, leading to an increased gene expression of IFIT1 and IFIT3, responsible for antiviral control. The overexpression of these proteins reduced the expression of NS1 and VP2 viral genes and hence viral replication. MAVS and STING expression on infected cells showed a mild increase compared to IFN�, suggesting that the viral infection could partially modify its expression. All results obtained in this study showed that during CPV-2c infection in MDCK cells, the IFN� expression was altered since this cytokine is one of the most critical factors for the control and inhibition of viral replication.",

However, there is limited information describing the genes or microRNAs (miRNAs) that play a role in replicating REV-spleen necrosis virus (SNV). Our previous miRNA and RNA sequencing data showed that the expression of gga-miR-222b-5p was significantly upregulated in REV-SNV-infected chicken spleens of 7, 14, and 21 dpi compared to non-infected chicken spleens, but mitogen-activated protein kinase 10 (MAPK10), which is related to innate immunity, had the opposite expression pattern. To understand chicken cellular miRNA function in the virus-host interactions during REV infection, we used quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) to determine whether the expression of gga-miR-222b-5p and MAPK10 in the spleen of specific-pathogen-free chickens at 28, 35, and 42 dpi was consistent with the first 3 time points, and dual-luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the targeting relationship between gga-miR-222b-5p and MAPK10. Results show that MAPK10 was downregulated at all 3 time points; however, significant difference (p?0.01) was noted only at 35 dpi. Moreover, the expression of gga-miR-222b-5p was upregulated; however, significant difference (p?0.01) was observed only at 28 and 35 dpi. A dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that MAPK10 is a direct target of gga-miR-222b-5p. This study suggests that gga-miR-222b-5p may target MAPK10 to promote the REV-SNV-induced tumorigenesis via the RLRs signaling pathway.",

Cows (n=240) diagnosed ultrasonographically as non-pregnant and with a mature corpus were treated with a single PGF2� administration and inseminated at detected estrus. Cows without corpus (n=277) were treated with the Ovsynch protocol. The estrus detection rate after PGF2� administration, percentages of cows pregnant after the treatment and at day 260, intervals from parturition to treatment and from treatment to conception and pregnancy loss rates were calculated. The overall percentage of cows pregnant after treatment did not differ between animals treated with the Ovsynch protocol and with PGF2� (38.9% vs. 42.5%; p>0.05). In herd A the percentage of cows pregnant after treatment was significantly lower (p?0.05) for the Ovsynch group than for the PGF2� group (30.2% vs. 61.2%). In contrast, in herd C the percentage of cows pregnant after treatment was significantly higher (p?0.05) in the Ovsych group than in the PGF2� group (39.6% vs. 28.8%). The overall estrus detection rate after administration of PGF2� was 59.6%. However, it was significantly lower (p?0.05) in herd C (44.7%) than in herds A (79.6%) and B (76.3%). The overall pregnancy loss rate ranged from 5.1% to 13.3% and did not differ significantly between herds and treatment groups (p>0.05).

In addition, species identification was performed by nested PCR targeting the Cryptosporidium spp. COWP gene and sequencing. Cryptosporidium spp. was detected in 11 calves (30.55%; 11/36) by real-time PCR and the cows were negative. Among real-time PCR positive samples, only five were also found positive by microscopy. Moreover, Cryptosporidium spp. was found in one of the two artesian water sources and five environmental samples by real-time PCR. Among these positive samples, eight were sequenced. According to the RFLP pattern, BLAST and, phylogenetic analyses, all sequenced samples were Cryptosporidium parvum. These findings show the importance of C. parvum as a cause of calf diarrhea on dairy farms.",

This study aimed to examine the effects of 1) time of sample collection, 2) delay to centrifugation, 3) sample matrix types, and 4) device and duration of sample storage on the T concentrations. Blood samples were collected from 34 bucks of Kacang goats. For testing the effect of collection time, 12 pairs of morning and afternoon samples were collected. For testing the effect of delayed centrifugation, 24 samples were subjected to treatments: (i) centrifuged ?1 hour after collection (control group), (ii) centrifuged 6, 12, and 24 hours after collection (test groups). For testing the different sample matrix types, 10 samples were processed as serum and plasma. For testing the effect of sample storage device and duration, 60 samples were subjected to treatments: i) frozen at -20OC (control group), ii) stored in a cooler box, a styrofoam box, and a thermos-flask for two, four, and six days (test groups). T concentrations were measured using a validated testosterone ELISA kit. Concentrations of plasma testosterone (pT) from morning samples were significantly higher compared to afternoon samples (p?0.05). Delayed centrifugation for up to 24 h decreased significantly on pT concentrations (p?0.05). The concentrations of T from serum and plasma did not differ and showed a strong correlation (r=0.981). Storage device and duration affected the T concentrations compared to frozen samples (p?0.05) which T concentrations were stable for up to 4 days in a styrofoam box and a thermos-flask and up to 6 days in a cooler box. In conclusion, the measurement accuracy and stability of T concentrations in goats are affected by collection time, delay to centrifugation, and device and duration of storage.",

The study was performed on 400 pigs in total and 60 pigs from this group were used to evaluate the effect of the product tested on the post-vaccinal response. The animals were divided into two groups: control group, fed without additive of LAVIPAN PL5 and the study group, receiving LAVIPAN PL5 at doses recommended by manufacturer from weaning to the end of fattening. The following parameters were recorded: main production parameters, including weight gains, fattening time (slaughter age) and animal health status during the study (mortality), and specific humoral post-vaccinal response after vaccination against swine erysipelas. The results indicate that the application of LAVIPAN PL5 had positive influence on the animals` productivity and did not significantly affect the post-vaccinal antibody levels and the development and maintenance of the post-vaccinal response, albeit the levels of antibodies were slightly higher in the animal receiving the test preparation. The higher average daily weight gains (by over 3%) which resulted in a 2 kg higher average weight at slaughter and a reduction of the fattening period by 5 days, undoubtedly contributed to significant economic benefits.",

Furthermore, the study was used to assess the risk of eating venison. Samples were analyzed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The average concentration of Se was 3.9 (p?0.001) and 1.8-fold higher (p0.001) in the wild boar and red fox, respectively, in comparison to the red deer, and 2.1-fold higher in the wild boar comparing to the red fox (p?0.001). There was no difference in the average concentration of Zn. The average concentration of Cu was 9.3. Concentration of this element was 5.4-fold higher in red deer in comparison to red fox (p?0.001) and 9,34-fold higher than in wild boar (p?0.001). The average concentration of Cd was 1.9-fold higher in wild boar in comparison to the red fox (p?0.029). Correlation between Cu and Cd concentrations was also observed in the case of the red deer and red fox, while no such correlations were observed between the tested elements in the wild boar. In conclusion, the liver concentrations of these heavy metals in selected wild animas species from the hunting areas of Warmia and Mazury, do not exceed standard safe values for consumers.

Recent reports indicate the role of chicken proventricular necrosis virus (CPNV) in the development of TVP. However, the relationship between CPNV and TVP is inconclusive and it has been addressed in just a few reports. Given the above, a study was conducted to identify the relationship between TVP and CPNV prevalence in broiler chickens in Poland. The study was carried out on 35 proventriculi samples sent for histopathological (HP) examination to the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Olsztyn between 2017 and 2019. After HP examination, TVP positive samples were processed for CPNV identification by RT-PCR. TVP was the most common pathological condition of proventriculi (23 cases). CPNV was identified in 10 out of those 23 cases. The average HP score, and the average necrosis and infiltration score for CPNV-positive samples was significantly higher than in CPNV-negative ones. The average age of the CPNV-positive chickens was significantly lower than in CPNV-negative birds. Our study confirms the role of CPNV in TVP pathogenesis and it seems that preservation of the proventriculi in the early stages of the disease, when the lesions are more pronounced, should result in a greater probability of CPNV detection.",

Herein, we described the dynamic of SARS-CoV-2 strains circulating in Brazil from May to September 2020, to better understand viral changes that may affect the ongoing pandemic. Our data demonstrate that some of the mutations identified are currently observed in variants of interest and variants of concern, and emphasize the importance of studying previous periods in order to comprehend the emergence of new variants. From 720 SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences, we found few sites under positive selection pressure, such as the D614G (98.5 %) in the spike, that has replaced the old variant; the V1167F in the spike (41 %), identified in the P.2 variant that emerged from Brazil during the period of analysis; and I292T (39 %) in the N protein. There were a few alterations in the UTRs, which was expected, however, our data suggest that the emergence of new variants was not influenced by mutations in UTR regions, since it maintained its conformational structure in most analysed sequences. In phylogenetic analysis, the spread of SARS-CoV-2 from the large urban centres to the countryside during these months could be explained by the flexibilization of social isolation measures and also could be associated with possible new waves of infection. These results allow a better understanding of SARS-CoV-2 strains that have circulated in Brazil, and thus, with relevant infomation, provide the potential viral changes that may have affected and/or contributed to the current and future scenario of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Yet how these changes influence the neuronal computations necessary for normal brain function are not well understood. To identify cellular mechanisms underlying the maturation of synaptic integration in interneurons, we combined patch-clamp recordings of excitatory inputs in mouse cerebellar stellate cells (SCs), three-dimensional reconstruction of SC morphology with excitatory synapse location, and biophysical modeling. We found that postnatal maturation of postsynaptic strength was homogeneously reduced along the somatodendritic axis, but dendritic integration was always sublinear. However, dendritic branching increased without changes in synapse density, leading to a substantial gain in distal inputs. Thus, changes in synapse distribution, rather than dendrite cable properties, are the dominant mechanism underlying the maturation of neuronal computation. These mechanisms favor the emergence of a spatially compartmentalized two-stage integration model promoting location-dependent integration within dendritic subunits.",

Analyses were conducted on the modified intention-to-treat population (participants who took at least one dose of study drug and completed one follow-up survey) and adjusted for stratified randomisation by sex.RESULTS: The modified intention-to-treat population included 203 participants: 105 were randomly assigned to ciclesonide (excluding two dropouts and one loss to follow-up) and 98 to placebo (excluding three dropouts and six losses to follow-up). The median age was 35 years (interquartile range 27-47 years) and 54% were women. The proportion of participants with resolution of symptoms by day 7 did not differ significantly between the intervention group (42/105, 40%) and control group (34/98, 35%); absolute adjusted risk difference 5.5% (95% confidence interval -7.8% to 18.8%). Results might be limited to the population studied, which mainly included younger adults without comorbidities. The trial was stopped early, therefore could have been underpowered.CONCLUSION: Compared with placebo, the combination of inhaled and intranasal ciclesonide did not show a statistically significant increase in resolution of symptoms among healthier young adults with covid-19 presenting with prominent respiratory symptoms. As evidence is insufficient to determine the benefit of inhaled and intranasal corticosteroids in the treatment of covid-19, further research is needed.TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04435795.",

Alarming concern is, the number of second wave infections surpassed the first wave and the onset of severe symptoms manifesting rapidly. In this scenario, testing of maximum population in less time and minimum cost with existing diagnostic amenities is the only possible way to control the spread of the virus. The previously described RNA extraction-free methods using dry swab have been shown to be advantageous in these critical times by different studies. In this work, we show the temporal stability and performance of the dry swab viral detection method at two different temperatures. Contrived dry swabs holding serially diluted SARS-CoV-2 strains A2a and A3i at 25�C (room temperature; RT) and 4�C were subjected to direct RT-PCR and compared with standard VTM-RNA based method. The results clearly indicate that dry swab method of RNA detection is as efficient as VTM-RNA-based method in both strains, when checked for up to 72 h. The lesser CT values of dry swab samples in comparison to that of the VTM-RNA samples suggest better sensitivity of the method within 48 h of time. The results collectively suggest that dry swab samples are stable at RT for 24 h and the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA by RT-PCR do not show variance from VTM-RNA. This extraction free, direct RT-PCR method holds phenomenal standing in the present life-threatening circumstances due to SARS-CoV-2.",

Current devices suffer from high fit-failure rates leaving significant proportions of users exposed to risk of viral infection. Driven by non-contact, portable, and widely available 3D scanning technologies, a workflow is presented whereby a user's face is rapidly categorised using relevant facial parameters. Device design is then directed down either a semi-customised or fully-customised route. Semi-customised designs use the extracted eye-to-chin distance to categorise users in to pre-determined size brackets established via a cohort of 200 participants encompassing 87.5% of the cohort. The user's nasal profile is approximated to a Gaussian curve to further refine the selection in to one of three subsets. Flexible silicone provides the facial interface accommodating minor mismatches between true nasal profile and the approximation, maintaining a good seal in this challenging region. Critically, users with outlying facial parameters are flagged for the fully-customised route whereby the silicone interface is mapped to 3D scan data. These two approaches allow for large scale manufacture of a limited number of design variations, currently nine through the semi-customised approach, whilst ensuring effective device fit. Furthermore, labour-intensive fully-customised designs are targeted as those users who will most greatly benefit. By encompassing both approaches, the presented workflow balances manufacturing scale-up feasibility with the diverse range of users to provide well-fitting devices as widely as possible. Novel flow visualisation on a model face is presented alongside qualitative fit-testing of prototype devices to support the workflow methodology.",

We therefore update our systematic review to answer the following research questions: (1) Do patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treated with IL-6 (receptor) antagonists have lower mortality compared to standard of care? (2) Do patients hospitalized for COVID-19 treated with IL-6 (receptor) antagonists have more side effects compared to standard of care? The following databases were search up to December 1st 2020: PubMed, PMC PubMed Central, MEDLINE, WHO COVID-19 Database, Embase, Web-of-Science, COCHRANE LIBRARY, Emcare and Academic Search Premier. In order to pool the risk ratio (RR) and risk difference of individual studies we used random effects meta-analysis. The search strategy retrieved 2975 unique titles of which 71 studies (9 RCTs and 62 observational) studies comprising 29,495 patients were included. Mortality (RR 0.75) and mechanical ventilation (RR 0.78) were lower and the risk of neutropenia (RR 7.3), impaired liver function (RR 1.67) and secondary infections (RR 1.26) were higher for patients treated with IL-6 (receptor) antagonists compared to patients not treated with treated with IL-6 (receptor) antagonists. Our results showed that IL-6 (receptor) antagonists are effective in reducing mortality in COVID-19 patients, while the risk of side effects was higher. The baseline risk of mortality was an important effect modifier: IL-6 (receptor) antagonists were effective when the baseline mortality risk was high (e.g. ICU setting), while they could be harmful when the baseline mortality risk was low.",

We examined time-trend specificities based on sex, age, and cause of death in the last 2�years of life. Datasets containing all hospitalizations and EDVs of elderly residents in Friuli-Venezia�Giulia, Italy (N = 411,812), who died between 2002 and 2014 at ? 65�years, have been collected. We performed subgroup change-point analysis of monthly trends in the 2�years preceding death according to sex, age at death (65-74, 75-84, 85-94, and ? 95�years), and main cause of death (cancer, cardiovascular, or respiratory disease). The proportion of decedents (N = 142,834) accessing acute healthcare services increased exponentially in proximity to death (hospitalizations = 4.7, EDVs = 3.9�months before death). This was inversely related to age, with changes among the youngest and eldest decedents at 6.6 and 3.5�months for hospitalizations and at 4.6 and 3.3�months for EDVs, respectively. Healthcare use among cancer patients intensified earlier in life (hospitalizations = 6.8, EDVs = 5.8�months before death). Decedents from respiratory diseases were most likely to access hospital-based services during the last month of life. No sex-based differences were found. The greater use of acute healthcare services among younger decedents and cancer patients suggests that policies potentiating primary care support targeting these at-risk groups may reduce pressure on hospital-based services.",

The present study directly examined how during the pandemic, healthy individuals select between regulatory strategies to cope with varying COVID-19-related threats, and whether an adaptive flexible regulatory selection pattern will emerge in this unique threatening global context. Accordingly, this two-study investigation tested how healthy individuals during a strict state issued quarantine, behaviorally select to regulate COVID-19-related threats varying in their intensity. Study 1 created and validated an ecologically relevant set of low and high intensity sentences covering major COVID-19 facets that include experiencing physical symptoms, infection threats, and social and economic consequences. Study 2 examined the influence of the intensity of these COVID-19-related threats, on behavioral regulatory selection choices between disengagement via attentional distraction and engagement via reappraisal. Confirming a flexible regulatory selection conception, healthy individuals showed strong choice preference for engagement reappraisal when regulating low intensity COVID-19-related threats, but showed strong choice preference for disengagement distraction when regulating high intensity COVID-19-related threats. These findings support the importance of regulatory selection flexibility for psychological resilience during a major global crisis.",

The aim was to assess concentrations of chemerin, omentin, and vaspin among COVID-19 patients with an emphasis on adipokines relationship with COVID-19 severity, concomitant metabolic abnormalities and liver dysfunction. Serum chemerin, omentin and vaspin concentrations were measured in serum collected from 70 COVID-19 patients at the moment of admission to hospital, before any treatment was applied and 20 healthy controls. Serum chemerin and omentin concentrations were significantly decreased in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy volunteers (271.0 vs. 373.0�ng/ml; p < 0.001 and 482.1 vs. 814.3�ng/ml; p = 0.01, respectively). There were no correlations of analyzed adipokines with COVID-19 severity based on the presence of pneumonia, dyspnea, or necessity of Intensive Care Unit hospitalization (ICU). Liver test abnormalities did not influence adipokines levels. Elevated GGT activity was associated with ICU admission, presence of pneumonia and elevated concentrations of CRP, ferritin and interleukin 6. Chemerin and omentin depletion in COVID-19 patients suggests that this adipokines deficiency play influential role in disease pathogenesis. However, there was no relationship between lower adipokines level and frequency of COVID-19 symptoms as well as disease severity. The only predictive factor which could predispose to a more severe COVID-19 course, including the presence of pneumonia and ICU hospitalization, was GGT activity.",

Among a total of 13,435 vaccinated healthcare workers, we received 3236 self-declaration reports of Sputnik V associated adverse events with the mean age 39.32 � 10.19�years old which 38.8% were men and 61.2% were women. Totally 68.8% of females versus 66.2% of males reported side effects after receiving the first dose and 31.2% of females versus 33.8% of males reported side effects after the second dose of vaccine. The most common side effect was a pain in the injection site (56.9%), fatigue (50.9%), body pain (43.9%), headache (35.7%), fever (32.9%), joint pain (30.3%), chilling (29.8%) and drowsiness (20.3%). Side effects of the vaccine were significantly more frequent in females and younger individuals. Among a total of 238 participants, more than 90% after the first and second dose of vaccine had a detectable level of SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibody and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody.

A retrospective cohort of COVID-19, Influenza and RSV patients admitted to the Tel Aviv Medical Center from January 2010 to October 2020 was analyzed. Laboratory, demographic, and clinical parameters were collected. Two way analyses of variance (ANOVA) was used to compare the association between NLR values and poor outcomes among the three groups. ROC curve analyses for each virus was applied to test the discrimination ability of NLR. 722 COVID-19, 2213 influenza and 482 RSV patients were included. Above the age of 50, NLR at admission was significantly lower among COVID-19 patients (P < 0.001). NLR was associated with poor clinical outcome only in the COVID-19 group. ROC curve analysis was performed; the area under curve of poor outcomes for COVID-19 was 0.68, compared with 0.57 and 0.58 for Influenza and RSV respectively. In the COVID-19 group, multivariate logistic regression identified a high NLR (defined as a value above 6.82) to be a prognostic factor for poor clinical outcome, after adjusting for age, sex and Charlson comorbidity score (odds ratio of 2.9, P < 0.001).

Weekly indicators for the period January-July 2020 were compared with the corresponding average for 2018-2019; comparisons were performed within 3 sub-periods: pre-lockdown, lockdown, and post-lockdown. The weekly trend of hospitalisations for ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) showed a 40% reduction, but the proportion of STEMI patients with a primary PTCA did not significantly change from previous years. Malignant neoplasms surgery volumes differed substantially by site, with a limited reduction for lung cancer (< 20%) and greater declines (30-40%) for breast and prostate cancers. The percentage of timely surgery for femoral neck in the elderly remained constantly higher than the previous 2�years whereas hip and knee replacements fell dramatically. Hospitalisations have generally decreased, but the capacity of a timely and effective response in time-dependent pathways of care was not jeopardized throughout the period. General trends did not show important differences across regions, regardless of the different burden of Covid-19.

More than 143 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported to date, with the global death rate at 2.13%. Currently, there are no licensed therapeutics for controlling SARS-CoV-2 infection. The antiviral effects of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), a cytoprotective enzyme that inhibits the inflammatory response and reduces oxidative stress, have been investigated in several viral infections. To confirm whether HO-1 suppresses SARS-CoV-2 infection, we assessed the antiviral activity of hemin, an effective and safe HO-1 inducer, in SARS-CoV-2 infection. We found that treatment with hemin efficiently suppressed SARS-CoV-2 replication (selectivity index: 249.7012). Besides, the transient expression of HO-1 using an expression vector also suppressed the growth of the virus in cells. Free iron and biliverdin, which are metabolic byproducts of heme catalysis by HO-1, also suppressed the viral infection. Additionally, hemin indirectly increased the expression of interferon-stimulated proteins known to restrict SARS-CoV-2 replication. Overall, the findings suggested that HO-1, induced by hemin, effectively suppressed SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. Therefore, HO-1 could be potential therapeutic candidate for COVID-19.",

To understand the changes in viral genomic diversity and molecular epidemiology in Oxford during the first wave of infections in the United Kingdom, we analyzed 563 clinical SARS-CoV-2 samples via whole-genome sequencing using Nanopore MinION sequencing. Large-scale surveillance efforts during viral epidemics are likely to be confounded by the number of independent introductions of the viral strains into a region. To avoid such issues and better understand the selection-based changes occurring in the SARS-CoV-2 genome, we utilized local isolates collected during the UK's first national lockdown whereby personal interactions, international and national travel were considerably restricted and controlled. We were able to track the short-term evolution of the virus, detect the emergence of several mutations of concern or interest, and capture the viral diversity of the region. Overall, these results demonstrate genomic pathogen surveillance efforts have considerable utility in controlling the local spread of the virus.",

Incorporating testing-isolation process and individual-level viral load trajectories into an epidemic model, we further studied the impacts of testing-isolation on test sensitivities. Results show that the testing-isolation process could maintain a stable test sensitivity during the outbreak by removing most infected individuals, especially during the epidemic decline. Moreover, we compared the efficiency, accuracy, and cost of different screening methods during the pandemic. Our results show that PCR-based pooled screening is cost-effective in reversing the pandemic at low prevalence. When the prevalence is high, PCR-based pooled screening may not stop the outbreak. In contrast, antigen screening with sufficient frequency could reverse the epidemic, despite the high cost and the large numbers of false positives in the screening process.",

Like other biomedical topic areas, biofluids education must address highly interdisciplinary and applied topics. Concept/problem-based active learning approaches can provide effective avenues to teach such diverse and applied topics. However, with the heterogeneity within biofluids topics across cellular, physiological, and/or extra-organismal scales, it is important to develop active learning content that enables students to explore concepts with appropriate context. This challenge is further complicated by the need to administer such content remotely (due to the Covid-19 pandemic). Here, we outline our design process and implementation experience for simulation-based active learning modules for a newly developed physiological biofluids course. We share the overall design approach, with two example cases of simulation-based concept exploration: (a) arterial Windkessel effects and lumped parameter hemodynamic analysis; and (b) curvature-induced helical flow in human aorta illustrated using four-dimensional (4D) flow magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Evidence from student survey ratings, student comments and feedback, and monitoring student performance for course deliverables indicate positive student response toward these modules, and efficacy of the modules in enabling student learning. Based on our design and implementation experience, we argue that simulation-based approaches can enable active learning of biofluids through remote and online learning modalities.",

The concentration of G-17 in the serum was detected with the double-antibody sandwich method.RESULTS: The limit of background(LOB), limit of detection (LOD), and limit of quantification (LOQ) were 0.09, 0.104, and 0.39�pmol/L, respectively. The detection range of G-17-TRFIA was 0.39-100�pmol/L. The average intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were 5.95%-9.07% and 6.09%-8.14%, respectively. The recoveries for the serum samples ranged from 94.70% to 100.95%. The specificity of our G-17-TRFIA was acceptable.

Serum samples were collected and tested for total antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 employing Roche Elecsys Anti-SARS-CoV-2 Immunoassay. Results were reported as reactive or non-reactive. According to patient exposure the staff were divided into low risk (technicians, domestic and administrative staff) and high risk (nurses, ophthalmologists, anaesthesiologists, and optometrists). Among those with positive antibodies, they were given a survey that included demographic characteristics, COVID-19 exposure, and related symptomatology. Logistic regression was used to determine the factors associated with antibody positivity.RESULTS: On November 25th a total of 94 healthcare workers were sero-surveyed, mean age was 34.15�years (�8.41), most (57.44%) were females. Seroprevalence was 18%, the majority (77%) were in the low-risk group; while 64% at high-risk, tested negative. Those at low exposure, were five times more likely to have antibodies than those at high exposure (OR:5.69; 95% CI 1.69-19.13). Age and gender were not associated to seropositivity.CONCLUSIONS: We found a similar seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in EHCW to what has been reported in other healthcare groups. Seropositivity was higher among HCW with fewer patient exposure, hence the probability of community transmission.Key messagesEven though eye healthcare workers are believed to be at higher risk of infection, the prevalence of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in this group is comparable to what has been reported previously in other healthcare groups.",

As a result, a large amount of N fertilizer is used to improve the yield in modern tea production. Unfortunately, the large amount of N fertilizer input has led to increased plant nitrogen-tolerance and decreased amplitude of yield improvement, which results in significant N loss, energy waste and environment pollution. However, the effects of N-deficiency on the metabolic profiles of tea leaves and roots are not well understood.RESULTS: In this study, seedlings of Camellia sinensis (L.) O. Kuntze Chunlv 2 were treated with 3 mM NH4NO3 (Control) or without NH4NO3 (N-deficiency) for 4 months by sandy culture. The results suggested that N-deficiency induced tea leaf chlorosis, impaired biomass accumulation, decreased the leaf chlorophyll content and N absorption when they were compared to the Control samples. The untargeted metabolomics based on GC-TOF/MS approach revealed a discrimination of the metabolic profiles between N-deficient tea leaves and roots. The identification and classification of the altered metabolites indicated that N deficiency upregulated the relative abundances of most phenylpropanoids and organic acids, while downregulated the relative abundances of most amino acids in tea leaves. Differentially, N-deficiency induced the accumulation of most carbohydrates, organic acids and amino acids in tea roots. The potential biomarkers screened in N-deficient leaves compared to Control implied that N deficiency might reduce the tea quality. Unlike the N-deficient leaves, the potential biomarkers in N-deficient roots indicated an improved stress response might occur in tea roots.CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated N deficiency had different effects on the primary and secondary metabolism in tea leaves and roots. The findings of this study will facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the N-deficient tea plants and provide a valuable reference for the optimized N nutrient management and the sustainable development in the tea plantations.",

Chinese government has promptly taken quarantine measures to block the transmission of the COVID-19, which may cause deleterious consequences on everyone's behaviors and psychological health. Few studies have examined the associations between behavioral and mental health in different endemic areas. This study aimed to describe screen time (ST), physical activity (PA), and depressive symptoms, as well as their associations among Chinese college students according to different epidemic areas.METHODS: The study design is cross-sectional using online survey, from 4 to 12 February 2020, 14,789 college students accomplished this online study, participants who did not complete the questionnaire were excluded, and finally this study included 11,787 college students from China.RESULTS: The average age of participants was 20.51 � 1.88 years. 57.1% of the college students were male. In total, 25.9% of college students reported depression symptoms. ST > 4 h/day was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (� = 0.48, 95%CI 0.37-0.59). COVID-19ST > 1 h/day was positively correlated with depressive symptoms (� = 0.54, 95%CI 0.43-0.65), compared with COVID-19ST ? 0.5 h/day. Compared with PA ? 3 day/week, PA < 3 day/week was positively associated with depression symptoms (� = 0.01, 95%CI 0.008-0.012). Compared with low ST and high PA, there was an interaction association between high ST and low PA on depression (� = 0.31, 95%CI 0.26-0.36). Compared with low COVID-19ST and high PA, there was an interaction association between high COVID-19ST and low PA on depression (� = 0.37, 95%CI 0.32-0.43). There were also current residence areas differences.CONCLUSIONS: Our findings identified that high ST or low PA was positively associated with depressive symptoms independently, and there was also an interactive effect between ST and PA on depressive symptoms.",

The children included had completed a language or mathematics test as part of the Danish National Test Program between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2018. The age range of the eligible schoolchildren was 7 to 17 years.Exposures: Maternal prescription fill for antidepressants during pregnancy, obtained from the Danish Prescription Register.Main Outcomes and Measures: The difference in standardized scores between children with and without maternal prescription fill for antidepressants in mathematics and language tests (scale, 1-100; higher scores indicate better test results) was estimated using linear regression models, adjusted for relevant confounders. Ten sensitivity analyses were performed, including a sibling-controlled analysis.Results: Among the 575 369 children included (51.1% males), 10 198 (1.8%) were born to mothers filling an antidepressant prescription during pregnancy. The mean (SD) age of children at the time of testing spanned from 8.9 (0.4) years in grade 2 to 14.9 (0.4) years in grade 8. Maternal prescription fill for antidepressants was significantly associated with a poorer performance in mathematics (mean test scores for the group exposed to maternal antidepressant fill: 52.1 [95% CI, 51.7-52.6] and for the group not exposed to maternal antidepressant fill: 57.4 [95% CI, 57.3-57.4]; adjusted difference, -2.2 [95% CI, -2.7 to -1.6]), but not in language (mean test scores for the exposed group: 53.4 [95% CI, 53.1-53.7] and for the not exposed group: 56.6 [95% CI, 56.5-56.6]; adjusted difference, -0.1 [95% CI, -0.6 to 0.3]). In the sibling-controlled analysis, the adjusted difference in mathematics (mean scores for the exposed group: 53.5 [95% CI, 52.7-54.3] and for the not exposed group: 59.0 [95% CI, 58.9-59.1]) was -2.8 (95% CI, -4.5 to -1.2) and in language (mean test scores for the exposed group: 53.9 [95% CI, 53.2-54.6] and for the not exposed group: 56.6 [95% CI, 56.5-56.7]) was -0.3 (95% CI, -1.9 to 1.2).Conclusions and Relevance: In this study of public schoolchildren in Denmark, children whose mothers had filled prescriptions for antidepressants during pregnancy, compared with children whose mothers did not fill prescriptions for antidepressants during pregnancy, had a 2-point lower standardized test score in mathematics, a difference that was statistically significant, but had no significant difference in language test scores. The magnitude of the difference in the mathematics test score was small and of uncertain clinical importance, and the findings must be weighed against the benefits of treating maternal depression during pregnancy.",

The noninferiority margin was 8%. Secondary outcomes included severity/duration of 9 parent-reported CAP symptoms, 3 antibiotic-related adverse events, and phenotypic resistance in colonizing Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates.Results: Of 824 participants randomized into 1 of the 4 groups, 814 received at least 1 dose of trial medication (median [IQR] age, 2.5 years [1.6-2.7]; 421 [52%] males and 393 [48%] females), and the primary outcome was available for 789 (97%). For lower vs higher dose, the primary outcome occurred in 12.6% with lower dose vs 12.4% with higher dose (difference, 0.2% [1-sided 95% CI -? to 4.0%]), and in 12.5% with 3-day treatment vs 12.5% with 7-day treatment (difference, 0.1% [1-sided 95% CI -? to 3.9]). Both groups demonstrated noninferiority with no significant interaction between dose and duration (P = .63). Of the 14 prespecified secondary end points, the only significant differences were 3-day vs 7-day treatment for cough duration (median 12 days vs 10 days; hazard ratio [HR], 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .04) and sleep disturbed by cough (median, 4 days vs 4 days; HR, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0 to 1.4]; P = .03). Among the subgroup of children with severe CAP, the primary end point occurred in 17.3% of lower-dose recipients vs 13.5% of higher-dose recipients (difference, 3.8% [1-sided 95% CI, -? to10%]; P value for interaction = .18) and in 16.0% with 3-day treatment vs 14.8% with 7-day treatment (difference, 1.2% [1-sided 95% CI, -? to 7.4%]; P value for interaction = .73).Conclusions and Relevance: Among children with CAP discharged from an emergency department or hospital ward (within 48 hours), lower-dose outpatient oral amoxicillin was noninferior to higher dose, and 3-day duration was noninferior to 7 days, with regard to need for antibiotic re-treatment. However, disease severity, treatment setting, prior antibiotics received, and acceptability of the noninferiority margin require consideration when interpreting the findings.Trial Registration: ISRCTN Identifier: ISRCTN76888927.",

The unvaccinated cohort was matched on a propensity score derived from age, sex, zip code, race, ethnicity, and previous number of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction tests. The final study cohort consisted of 8889 patients in the vaccinated group and 88 898 unvaccinated matched patients.Exposure: Single dose of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine.Main Outcomes and Measures: The incidence rate ratio of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the vaccinated vs unvaccinated control cohorts, measured by SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing.Results: The study was composed of 8889 vaccinated patients (4491 men [50.5%]; mean [SD] age, 52.4 [16.9] years) and 88 898 unvaccinated patients (44 748 men [50.3%]; mean [SD] age, 51.7 [16.7] years).

The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between serum vitamin D levels, oxidative stress markers and disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.METHODS: Vitamin D levels were measured in 33 patients with COVID-19. The total antioxidant power and plasma peroxides were determined in serum.RESULTS: Severe COVID-19 patients have lower vitamin D levels (18.39 � 2.29 ng/mL vs. 28.47 � 3.05 ng/mL, p < .05) and higher oxidative stress compared to the moderate group. When divided according to serum vitamin D levels, significantly higher values of LDH (604.8 � 76.98 IU/mL vs. 261.57 � 47.33 IU/mL) and D-dimer (5978 � 2028ng/mL vs. 977.7 � 172 ng/mL) were obtained in the group with vitamin D below 30 ng/mL, followed with significantly higher levels of plasma peroxides (d-ROMs: 414.9 � 15.82 U.Carr vs. 352.4 � 18.77 U.Carr; p < .05) and oxidative stress index (OSI: 92.25 � 6.60 vs. 51.89 � 6.45; p < .001).CONCLUSION: The presented data provide a justification to consider vitamin D as an important factor that could ameliorate disease severity through its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects.",

Existing studies typically examine whether mobility in specific localities increases or decreases at specific points in time and relate these changes to certain pandemic and policy events. However, a more comprehensive analysis of mobility change over time is needed. In this paper, we study mobility change in the US through a five-step process using mobility footprint data. (Step 1) Propose the Delta Time Spent in Public Places (�TSPP) as a measure to quantify daily changes in mobility for each US county from 2019-2020. (Step 2) Conduct Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to reduce the �TSPP time series of each county to lower-dimensional latent components of change in mobility. (Step 3) Conduct clustering analysis to find counties that exhibit similar latent components. (Step 4) Investigate local and global spatial autocorrelation for each component. (Step 5) Conduct correlation analysis to investigate how various population characteristics and behavior correlate with mobility patterns. Results show that by describing each county as a linear combination of the three latent components, we can explain 59% of the variation in mobility trends across all US counties. Specifically, change in mobility in 2020 for US counties can be explained as a combination of three latent components: 1) long-term reduction in mobility, 2) no change in mobility, and 3) short-term reduction in mobility. Furthermore, we find that US counties that are geographically close are more likely to exhibit a similar change in mobility. Finally, we observe significant correlations between the three latent components of mobility change and various population characteristics, including political leaning, population, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and unemployment. We find that our analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of mobility change in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Serological studies, through providing evidence of past infection, can aid understanding of the population dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 infection.OBJECTIVES: This systematic review of SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence studies in Europe was undertaken to inform public health strategies including vaccination, that aim to accelerate population immunity.METHODS: We searched the databases Web of Science, MEDLINE, EMBASE, SCOPUS, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and grey literature sources for studies reporting seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in Europe published between 01/12/2019-30/09/20. We provide a narrative synthesis of included studies. Studies were categorized into subgroups including healthcare workers (HCWs), community, outbreaks, pregnancy and children/school. Due to heterogeneity in other subgroups, we only performed a random effects meta-analysis of the seroprevalence amongst HCWs stratified by their country.RESULTS: 115 studies were included spanning 17 European countries, that estimated the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 from samples obtained between November 2019 -August 2020. A total of 54/115 studies included HCWs with a reported seroprevalence among HCWs ranging from 0.7% to 45.3%, which did not differ significantly by country. In community studies significant heterogeneity was reported in the seroprevalence between different age groups and the majority of studies reported there was no significant difference by gender.CONCLUSION: This review demonstrates a wide heterogeneity in reported seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies between populations. Continued evaluation of seroprevalence is required to understand the impact of public health measures and inform interventions including vaccination programmes.",

We included studies that reported original data and assessed self-medication to prevent or manage COVID-19. The risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) modified for cross-sectional studies.RESULTS: We identified eight studies, all studies were cross-sectional, and only one detailed the question used to assess self-medication. The recall period was heterogeneous across studies. Of the eight studies, seven assessed self-medication without focusing on a specific symptom: four performed in the general population (self-medication prevalence ranged between <4% to 88.3%) and three in specific populations (range: 33.9% to 51.3%). In these seven studies, the most used medications varied widely, including antibiotics, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, acetaminophen, vitamins or supplements, ivermectin, and ibuprofen. The last study only assessed self-medication for fever due to COVID-19. Most studies had a risk of bias in the \"representativeness of the sample\" and \"assessment of outcome\" items of the NOS.CONCLUSIONS: Studies that assessed self-medication for COVID-19 found heterogeneous results regarding self-medication prevalence and medications used.

The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that harmful alcohol use accounts for 5.1% of the global burden of disease and that 35.6 million people worldwide are affected by substance misuse. The Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has disrupted delivery of face-to-face alcohol and substance misuse interventions and has forced the development of alternative remote interventions or adaptation to existing ones. Although existing research on remote interventions suggests they might be as effective as face-to-face delivery, there has been a lack of systematic exploration of their content, the experience of service users, and their effectiveness for behavioural outcomes. This review will provide a narrative synthesis of the behaviour change techniques (BCT) contained in interventions for alcohol and/or substance misuse and their association with effectiveness.METHODS AND ANALYSIS: Systematic searches will be conducted in MEDLINE, Scopus, PsycINFO (ProQuest), and the Cochrane Library. Included studies will be those reporting remote interventions focusing on alcohol and/or substance misuse among adults living in the community and which have a primary behaviour change outcome (i.e., alcohol levels consumed). Data extraction will be conducted by one author and moderated by a second, and risk of bias and behaviour change technique (BCT) coding will be conducted by two authors independently. A narrative synthesis will be undertaken focussing upon the association of BCTs with intervention effectiveness using promise ratios.PATIENT AND PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT (PPI): The Public Involvement in Research Group (PIRG), part of the NIHR-funded PHIRST, will be involved in refining the review questions, eligibility criteria, data synthesis and dissemination.DISSEMINATION: Dissemination will be through an academic peer reviewed publication, alongside other outputs to be shared with non-academic policy, professional, and public audiences, including local authorities, service users and community organisations.",

This study was designed to elucidate the genetic modifiers of BSCR in HLA-A29 carriers.Methods: We sequenced the largest BSCR cohort to date, including 286 cases and 108 HLA-A29-positive controls to determine genome-wide common and rare variant associations. We further typed the HLA alleles of cases and 45,386 HLA-A29 controls of European ancestry to identify HLA alleles that associate with BSCR risk.Results: Carrying a second allele that belongs to the HLA-Aw19 broad antigen family (including HLA-A29, -A30, -A31, and -A33) increases the risk for BSCR (odds ratio [OR] = 4.44; P = 2.2e-03). This result was validated by comparing allele frequencies to large HLA-A29-controlled cohorts (n = 45,386; OR > 2.5; P < 1.3e-06). We also confirm that ERAP1 and ERAP2 haplotypes modulate disease risk. A meta-analysis with an independent dataset confirmed that ERAP1 and ERAP2 haplotypes modulate the risk for disease at a genome-wide significant level: ERAP1-rs27432 (OR = 2.46; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.85-3.26; P = 4.07e-10), an expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) decreasing ERAP1 expression; and ERAP2-rs10044354 (OR = 1.95; 95% CI, 1.55-2.44; P = 6.2e-09), an eQTL increasing ERAP2 expression. Furthermore, ERAP2-rs2248374 that disrupts ERAP2 expression is protective (OR = 0.56; 95% CI, 0.45-0.70; P = 2.39e-07). BSCR risk is additively increased when combining ERAP1/ERAP2 risk genotypes with two copies of HLA-Aw19 alleles (OR = 13.53; 95% CI, 3.79-54.77; P = 1.17e-05).Conclusions: The genetic factors increasing BSCR risk demonstrate a pattern of increased processing, as well as increased presentation of ERAP2-specific peptides. This suggests a mechanism in which exceeding a peptide presentation threshold activates the immune response in choroids of A29 carriers.",

Two authors searched the electronic databases PubMed, Embase, Scopus, the Cochrane Library, Web of Science, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and SPORTDiscus from August 2019-July 2021. Search terms included words related to \"long COVID\", \"athlete\" and \"return\". Data extraction was completed for each study by two independent investigators for: (1) first author name; (2) year of publication; (3) journal; (4) Definition of athlete (i.e. elite or non-elite) (5) Recommendations reported. A total of 220 records were found. Following title and abstract screening, 61 studies were eligible for full text screening. Overall, no studies, commentaries, editorials or reviews provided specific recommendations for \"long COVID\" defined as COVID-19 signs and symptoms lasting for over 4 weeks as a result of COVID-19 infection. In addition, we found no studies which reported symptoms of athletes suffering from long COVID. Despite the lack of evidence, we did find eight separate professional recommendations for managing \"long-term effects\" and \"ongoing\" or \"prolonged\" symptoms and COVID-19 complications among athletes. Practitioners should be aware of both mental and physical symptoms of long COVID, and additional considerations may be required for athletes who have undergone intensive care. The present review provides a list of recommendations based on existing literature that may be followed and implemented for returning athletes.Key MessagesFurther research, including longitudinal research of athletes who have tested positive for COVID-19, is required to develop evidenced-based guidelines for athletes with ongoing COVID-19 symptoms.Prior to returning to play after COVID-19 infection, a thorough medical history, physical and psychological examination should be conducted by a medical professional.Athletes should continue to monitor and record their own physical and psychological markers of health.",

Microbial populations can exhibit diverse individualistic behaviors, and yet can engage in collective migratory patterns with a spatially sorted arrangement of phenotypes. However, it is unclear how such spatially sorted patterns emerge from diverse individuals without complex computational abilities. Here, by investigating the single-cell trajectories during group migration, we discovered that, despite the constant migrating speed of a group, the drift velocities of individual bacteria decrease from the back to the front. With a Langevin-type modeling framework, we showed that this decreasing profile of drift velocities implies the spatial modulation of individual run-and-tumble random motions, and enables the bacterial population to migrate as a pushed wave front. Theoretical analysis and stochastic simulations further predicted that the pushed wave front can help a diverse population to stay in a tight group, while diverse individuals perform the same type of mean reverting processes around centers orderly aligned by their chemotactic abilities. This mechanism about the emergence of orderly collective migration from diverse individuals is experimentally demonstrated by titration of bacterial chemoreceptor abundance. These results reveal a simple computational principle for emergent ordered behaviors from heterogeneous individuals.",

(eLife, 2020; 9:e56344), we examined reports of sex differences and non-differences across nine biological disciplines. Sex differences were claimed in the majority of the 147 articles we analyzed; however, statistical evidence supporting those differences was often missing. For example, when a sex-specific effect of a manipulation was claimed, authors usually had not tested statistically whether females and males responded differently. Thus, sex-specific effects may be over-reported. In contrast, we also encountered practices that could mask sex differences, such as pooling the sexes without first testing for a difference. Our findings support the need for continuing efforts to train researchers how to test for and report sex differences in order to promote rigor and reproducibility in biomedical research.",

However, circumstances where antibody formation is impaired after vaccination, such as in older people, require us to better understand the cellular and molecular mechanisms that underpin successful vaccination in order to improve vaccine design for at-risk groups. Here, by studying the breadth of anti-haemagglutinin (HA) IgG, serum cytokines, and B and T cell responses by flow cytometry before and after influenza vaccination, we show that formation of circulating T follicular helper (cTfh) cells was associated with high-titre antibody responses. Using Major Histocompatability Complex (MHC) class II tetramers, we demonstrate that HA-specific cTfh cells can derive from pre-existing memory CD4+ T cells and have a diverse T cell receptor (TCR) repertoire. In older people, the differentiation of HA-specific cells into cTfh cells was impaired. This age-dependent defect in cTfh cell formation was not due to a contraction of the TCR repertoire, but rather was linked with an increased inflammatory gene signature in cTfh cells. Together, this suggests that strategies that temporarily dampen inflammation at the time of vaccination may be a viable strategy to boost optimal antibody generation upon immunisation of older people.",

However, suboptimal sampling of the molecular-dynamics simulation and modelling of crystallographic disorder has limited the utility of the method, and can lead to unphysical and strained models. Here, two improvements to the ensemble refinement method implemented within Phenix are presented: DEN restraints, which guide the local sampling of conformations and allow a more robust exploration of local conformational landscapes, and ECHT disorder models, which allow the selection of more physically meaningful and effective disorder models for parameterizing the continuous disorder components within a crystal. These improvements lead to more consistent and physically interpretable simulations of macromolecules in crystals, and allow structural heterogeneity and disorder to be systematically explored on different scales. The new approach is demonstrated on several case studies and the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, and demonstrates how the choice of disorder model affects the type of disorder that is sampled by the restrained molecular-dynamics simulation.",

Long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 4 (ACSL4) catalyzes the covalent addition of a CoA moiety to fatty acids, with a strong preference for AA and other PUFAs containing three or more double bonds. PUFA-CoA can be incorporated into phospholipids, which is the source of PUFA for lipid mediator synthesis. In this study, we demonstrated that deficiency of Acsl4 in mouse rpMACs resulted in a significant reduction of AA incorporated into all phospholipid classes and a reciprocal increase in incorporation of oleic acid and linoleic acid. After stimulation with opsonized zymosan (opZym), a diverse array of AA-derived lipid mediators, including leukotrienes, PGs, hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids, and lipoxins, were produced and were significantly reduced in Acsl4-deficient rpMACs. The Acsl4-deficient rpMACs stimulated with opZym also demonstrated an acute reduction in mRNA expression of the inflammatory cytokines, Il6, Ccl2, Nos2, and Ccl5 When Acsl4-deficient rpMACs were incubated in vitro with the TLR4 agonist, LPS, the levels of leukotriene B4 and PGE2 were also significantly decreased. In LPS-induced peritonitis, mice with myeloid-specific Acsl4 deficiency had a significant reduction in leukotriene B4 and PGE2 levels in peritoneal exudates, which was coupled with reduced infiltration of neutrophils in the peritoneal cavity as compared with wild-type mice. Our data demonstrate that chronic deficiency of Acsl4 in rpMACs reduces the incorporation of AA into phospholipids, which reduces lipid mediator synthesis and inflammation.",

For the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, it has become increasingly apparent that T cell responses are equally if not more important than humoral responses in mediating recovery and immune protection. One major challenge in developing T cell-based therapies for infectious and malignant diseases has been the identification of immunogenic epitopes that can elicit a meaningful T cell response. Traditionally, this has been achieved using sophisticated in silico methods to predict putative epitopes deduced from binding affinities. Our studies find that, in contrast to current convention, \"immunodominant\" SARS-CoV-2 peptides defined by such in silico methods often fail to elicit T cell responses recognizing naturally presented SARS-CoV-2 epitopes. We postulated that immunogenic epitopes for SARS-CoV-2 are best defined empirically by directly analyzing peptides eluted from the naturally processed peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and then validating immunogenicity by determining whether such peptides can elicit T cells recognizing SARS-CoV-2 antigen-expressing cells. Using a tandem mass spectrometry approach, we identified epitopes derived from not only structural but also nonstructural genes in regions highly conserved among SARS-CoV-2 strains, including recently recognized variants. Finally, there are no reported T cell receptor-engineered T cell technology that can redirect T cell specificity to recognize and kill SARS-CoV-2 target cells. We report here several SARS-CoV-2 epitopes defined by mass spectrometric analysis of MHC-eluted peptides, provide empiric evidence for their immunogenicity, and demonstrate engineered TCR-redirected killing.",

Cytokine storm is an important factor leading to death of patients with COVID-19. This study aims to characterize serum cytokines of patients with severe or critical COVID-19. Clinical records were obtained from 149 patients who were tested at the Sino-French New City Branch of Tongji Hospital from 30 January to 30 March 2020. Data regarding the clinical features of the patients was collected and analyzed. Among the 149, 45 (30.2%) of them had severe conditions and 104 (69.8%) of that presented critical symptoms. In the meantime, 80 (53.7%) of that 149 died during hospitalization. Of all, male patients accounted for 94 (69.1%). Compared with patients in severe COVID-19, those who in critical COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-� (TNF-�), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and IL-10. Moreover, the passed-away patients had considerably higher levels of TNF-�, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-10 than those survived from it. Regression analysis revealed that serum TNF-� level was an independent risk factor for the death of patient with severe conditions. Among the proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1�, TNF-�, IL-8, and IL-6) analyzed herein, TNF-� was seen as a risk factor for the death of patients with severe or critical COVID-19. This study suggests that anti-TNF-� treatment allows patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia to recover.",

We calibrated a detailed compartmental model of Victoria's second wave to multiple geographically-structured epidemic time-series indicators. We achieved a good fit overall and for individual health services through a combination of time-varying processes, including case detection, population mobility, school closures, physical distancing and face covering usage. Estimates of the risk of death in those aged ?75 and of hospitalisation were higher than international estimates, reflecting concentration of cases in high-risk settings. We estimated significant effects for each of the calibrated time-varying processes, with estimates for the individual-level effect of physical distancing of 37.4% (95%CrI 7.2-56.4%) and of face coverings of 45.9% (95%CrI 32.9-55.6%). That the multi-faceted interventions led to the dramatic reversal in the epidemic trajectory is supported by our results, with face coverings likely particularly important.",

To provide sufficient coverage for the world population, additional strategies need to be tested. The live pediatric measles vaccine (MV) is an attractive approach, given its extensive safety and efficacy history, along with its established large-scale manufacturing capacity. We develop an MV-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccine expressing the prefusion-stabilized, membrane-anchored full-length S antigen, which proves to be efficient at eliciting strong Th1-dominant T-cell responses and high neutralizing antibody titers. In both mouse and golden Syrian hamster models, these responses protect the animals from intranasal infectious challenge.

This study investigated the association between prognostic factors and disease outcomes of patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 with multiple S protein mutations. Fifty-one COVID-19 patients were recruited in this study. Whole-genome sequencing of 170 full-genomes of SARS-CoV-2 was conducted with the Illumina MiSeq sequencer. Most patients (47%) had mild symptoms of COVID-19 followed by moderate (19.6%), no symptoms (13.7%), severe (4%), and critical (2%). Mortality was found in 13.7% of the COVID-19 patients. There was a significant difference between the age of hospitalized patients (53.4 � 18�years) and the age of non-hospitalized patients (34.6 � 19) (p = 0.001). The patients' hospitalization was strongly associated with hypertension, diabetes, and anticoagulant and were strongly significant with the OR of 17 (95% CI 2-144; p = 0.001), 4.47 (95% CI 1.07-18.58; p = 0.039), and 27.97 (95% CI 1.54-507.13; p = 0.02), respectively; while the patients' mortality was significantly correlated with patients' age, anticoagulant, steroid, and diabetes, with OR of 8.44 (95% CI 1.5-47.49; p = 0.016), 46.8 (95% CI 4.63-472.77; p = 0.001), 15.75 (95% CI 2-123.86; p = 0.009), and 8.5 (95% CI 1.43-50.66; p = 0.019), respectively. This study found the clade: L (2%), GH (84.3%), GR (11.7%), and O (2%). Besides the D614G mutation, we found L5F (18.8%), V213A (18.8%), and S689R (8.3%). No significant association between multiple S protein mutations and the patients' hospitalization or mortality. Multivariate analysis revealed that hypertension and anticoagulant were the significant factors influencing the hospitalization and mortality of patients with COVID-19 with an OR of 17.06 (95% CI 2.02-144.36; p = 0.009) and 46.8 (95% CI 4.63-472.77; p = 0.001), respectively. Moreover, the multiple S protein mutations almost reached a strong association with patients' hospitalization (p = 0.07). We concluded that hypertension and anticoagulant therapy have a significant impact on COVID-19 outcomes. This study also suggests that multiple S protein mutations may impact the COVID-19 outcomes. This further emphasized the significance of monitoring SARS-CoV-2 variants through genomic surveillance, particularly those that may impact the COVID-19 outcomes.",

To demonstrate the utility of Melvin's Index, we used qRT-PCR to measure SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA levels in influent wastewater from 19 municipal wastewater treatment facilities (WWTF's) of varying sizes and served populations across the state of Minnesota during the Summer of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected at each WWTF during the 20-week sampling period at a mean concentration of 8.5 ? 104 genome copies/L (range 3.2 ? 102-1.2 ? 109 genome copies/L). Lag analysis of trends in Melvin's Index values and clinical COVID-19 cases showed that increases in indexed wastewater SARS-CoV-2 levels precede new clinical cases by 15-17�days at the statewide level and by up to 25�days at the regional/county level. Melvin's Index is a reliable WBE method and can be applied to both WWTFs that serve a wide range of population sizes and to large regions that are served by multiple WWTFs.",

Limit of detection (LoD) and reproducibility of the isolation-free SARS-CoV-2 RT-LAMP test were determined. An almost perfect agreement (Cohen's kappa > 0.8) between the novel test and two classical RT-PCR protocols with no systematic difference (McNemar's test, P > 0.05) was observed. Sensitivity and specificity were in the range of 89.5 to 100% and 96.2 to 100% dependent on the reaction condition and the RT-PCR method used as reference. The isolation-free RT-LAMP assay showed high reproducibility (Tt intra-run coefficient of variation [CV] = 0.4%, Tt inter-run CV = 2.1%) with a LoD of 95 SARS-CoV-2 genome copies per reaction.

Here we deployed \"Cohort Studies\", where we had in total 300 children with ASD (150 test group and 150 control group) to collect behavioral data. Our data collection continued through an extended COVID-19 lockdown and captured parent reports of 30 different behavioral parameters (e.g., self-injurious behaviors, aggression, sleep problems, daily living skills, and communication) across 150 children with ASD (test group). Based on the children's condition, 4-6 behavioral parameters were assessed through the study. A total of 56,290 behavioral data points was collected (an average of 152.19 per week) from parent cell phones using the mCARE platform. Children and their families were exposed to an extended COVID-19 lockdown. The main outcomes used for this study were generated from parent reports child behaviors within the mCARE platform. Behaviors included of child social skills, communication use, problematic behaviors, sensory sensitivities, daily living, and play.

By comparing the accuracy level of forecasting measurements with the basic ARIMA and NARANN models, it was shown that this novel data-driven hybrid model did a better job of capturing the dynamic changing trends of the target data than the others used in this work. Our proposed mixture technique can be deemed as a helpful policy-supportive tool to plan and provide medical supplies effectively. The overall confirmed cases and deaths were estimated to reach around 176,570 [95% uncertainty level (UL) 173,607 to 178,476] and 3454 (95% UL 3384 to 3487), respectively, in South Africa, along with 32,136 (95% UL 31,568 to 32,641) and 788 (95% UL 775 to 804) in Nigeria on 12 July 2020 using this data-driven EEMD-ARIMA-NARANN hybrid technique. The contributions of this study include three aspects. First, the proposed hybrid model can better capture the dynamic dependency characteristics compared with the individual models. Second, this new data-driven hybrid model is constructed in a more reasonable way relative to the traditional mixture model. Third, this proposed model may be generalized to estimate the epidemic patterns of COVID-19 in other regions.",

We collected information on demographic and clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and clinical outcomes. Logistic regression analysis was used to explore the risk factors associated with the severity of COVID-19. The association between myocardial enzyme abnormalities and the mortality was also investigated.Results: The mortality in abnormal myocardial enzyme group was obviously higher than the normal group (P < 0.001). The majority of patients (n = 72, 97.3%) with normal cardiac enzyme group were of the common novel coronavirus pneumonia (NCP) type, whereas half of the patients with cardiac enzyme abnormalities (n = 40, 48.2%) developed critical and severe NCP type. The multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that COVID-19 patients with increasing age (P = 0.035), higher levels of CRP (P = 0.038), and TNI (P = 0.036) were associated with increased death than other patients.Conclusions: Myocardial enzyme abnormality and myocardial injury were associated with the severity and fatal outcomes of COVID-19. Clinicians should pay attention to the markers of myocardial injury in COVID-19 patients, especially those with older age, comorbidities, and inflammation.",

In our hospital, we have implemented a two-level prescreening process in the outpatient clinic: an initial prescreening process at the entrance of the outpatient clinic (PPEO) and a second prescreening process is repeated in each department. If any symptoms or epidemiological history are identified at the second level, an emergency code is announced through the hospital's address system. The patient is then guided outside through a designated aisle. In this study, we analyze the cases missed in the PPEO that caused the emergency code to be applied.METHODS: All cases reported from March 2020 to April 2021 were analyzed retrospectively. We calculated the incidence of cases missed by the PPEO per 1,000 outpatients and compared the incidence between first-time hospital visitors and those visiting for the second time or more; morning and afternoon office hours; and days of the week.RESULTS: During the study period, the emergency code was applied to 449 cases missed by the PPEO. Among those cases, 20.7% were reported in otorhinolaryngology, followed by 11.6% in gastroenterology, 5.8% in urology, and 5.8% in dermatology. Fever was the most common symptom (59.9%), followed by cough (19.8%). The incidence of cases per 1,000 outpatients was significantly higher among first-time visitors than among those visiting for the second time or more (1.77 [confidence interval (CI), 1.44-2.10] vs. 0.59 [CI, 0.52-0.65], respectively) (P < 0.001).CONCLUSION: Fever was the most common symptom missed by the PPEO, and otorhinolaryngology and gastroenterology most frequently reported missed cases. Cases missed by the PPEO were more likely to occur among first-time visitors than returning visitors. The results obtained from this study can provide insights or recommendations to other healthcare facilities in operating prescreening processes during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Since its extracts have an astringent effect on human tissues, B. striata is widely used for hemostasis and healing. Recently, some other beneficial effects have also been uncovered, such as antioxidation, antiinflammation, antifibrotic, and immunomodulatory activities. As a key step towards a thorough understanding on the medicinal ingredient production in B. striata, deciphering the regulatory codes of the metabolic pathways becomes a major task.RESULTS: In this study, three organs (roots, tubers and leaves) of B. striata were analyzed by integrating transcriptome sequencing and untargeted metabolic profiling data. Five different metabolic pathways, involved in polysaccharide, sterol, flavonoid, terpenoid and alkaloid biosynthesis, were investigated respectively. For each pathway, the expression patterns of the enzyme-coding genes and the accumulation levels of the metabolic intermediates were presented in an organ-specific way. Furthermore, the relationships between enzyme activities and the levels of the related metabolites were partially inferred. Within the biosynthetic pathways of polysaccharides and flavonoids, long-range phytochemical transportation was proposed for certain metabolic intermediates and/or the enzymes.CONCLUSIONS: The data presented by this work could strengthen the molecular basis for further studies on breeding and medicinal uses of B. striata.",

        "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: The proper identification of feather grasses in nature is often limited due to phenotypic variability and high morphological similarity between many species. Among plausible factors influencing this issue are hybridisation and introgression recently detected in the genus. Nonetheless, to date, only a bounded set of taxa have been investigated using integrative taxonomy combining morphological and molecular data. Here, we report the first large-scale study on five feather grass species across several hybrid zones in Russia and Central Asia. In total, 302 specimens were sampled in the field and classified based on the current descriptions of these taxa. They were then genotyped with high density genome-wide markers and measured based on a set of morphological characters to delimitate species and assess levels of hybridisation and introgression. Moreover, we tested species for past introgression and estimated divergence times between them.RESULTS: Our findings demonstrated that 250 specimens represent five distinct species: S. baicalensis, S. capillata, S. glareosa, S. grandis and S. krylovii. The remaining 52 individuals provided evidence for extensive hybridisation between S. capillata and S. baicalensis, S. capillata and S. krylovii, S. baicalensis and S. krylovii, as well as to a lesser extent between S. grandis and S. krylovii, S. grandis and S. baicalensis. We detected past reticulation events between S. baicalensis, S. krylovii, S. grandis and inferred that diversification within species S. capillata, S. baicalensis, S. krylovii and S. grandis started ca. 130-96 kya. In addition, the assessment of genetic population structure revealed signs of contemporary gene flow between populations across species from the section Leiostipa, despite significant geographical distances between some of them. Lastly, we concluded that only 5 out of 52 hybrid taxa were properly identified solely based on morphology.CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that hybridisation is an important mechanism driving evolution in Stipa. As an outcome, this phenomenon complicates identification of hybrid taxa in the field using morphological characters alone. Thus, integrative taxonomy seems to be the only reliable way to properly resolve the phylogenetic issue of Stipa. Moreover, we believe that feather grasses may be a suitable genus to study hybridisation and introgression events in nature.",

Insufficient EPO production leads to anemia in patients with chronic kidney disease. Although recombinant EPO is effective to improve anemia, no reliable REP cell lines limit further progress of research and development of novel treatment.METHODS: We screened Epo mRNA expression in mouse fibroblast cell lines. Small interfering RNA specific for HIF1� or HIF2� was transfected to study Epo expression in C3H10T1/2 cells. The effect of transforming growth factor-�1 (TGF-�1) on HIF-EPO axis was studied in C3H10T1/2 cells and mice.RESULTS: Similar to mouse REP pericytes, C3H10T1/2 cells differentiated to �-smooth muscle actin+ myofibroblasts after exposure to TGF-�1. Specific HIF knockdown demonstrated the role of HIF2� in hypoxia-induced Epo expression. Sustained TGF-�1 exposure increased neither DNA methyltransferase nor methylation of Epas1 and Epo genes. However, TGF-�1 repressed HIF2�-encoding Epas1 promptly through activating activin receptor-like kinase-5 (ALK5), thereby decreasing Epo induction by hypoxia and prolyl hydroxylase domain inhibitor roxadustat. In mice with pro-fibrotic injury induced by ureteral obstruction, upregulation of Tgfb1 was accompanied with downregulation of Epas1 and Epo in injured kidneys and myofibroblasts, which were reversed by ALK5 inhibitor SB431542.CONCLUSION: C3H10T1/2 cells possessed the property of HIF2�-dependent Epo expression in REP pericytes. TGF-�1 induced not only the transition to myofibroblasts but also a repressive effect on Epas1-Epo axis in C3H10T1/2 cells. The repressive effect of TGF-�1 on Epas1-Epo axis was confirmed in REP pericytes in vivo. Inhibition of TGF-�1-ALK5 signaling might provide a novel treatment to rescue EPO expression in REP pericytes of injured kidney.",

Here, we experimentally test that possibility using a wild but habituated population of dwarf mongooses (Helogale parvula). First, we used natural and playback-simulated foraging displacements to demonstrate that bystanders take notice of the vocalisations produced during such within-group conflict events but that they do not engage in any immediate post-conflict affiliative behaviour with the protagonists or other bystanders. We then used another playback experiment to assess delayed effects of within-group conflict on grooming interactions: we examined affiliative behaviour at the evening sleeping burrow, 30-60 min after the most recent simulated foraging displacement. Overall, fewer individuals groomed on evenings following an afternoon of simulated conflict, but those that did groomed more than on control evenings. Subordinate bystanders groomed with the simulated aggressor significantly less, and groomed more with one another, on conflict compared to control evenings. Our study provides experimental evidence that dwarf mongooses acoustically obtain information about within-group contests (including protagonist identity), retain that information, and use it to inform conflict-management decisions with a temporal delay.",

This study aimed to evaluate the association between IBD therapies and severe COVID-19 outcomes.METHOD: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of all published studies from December 2019 to August 2021 to identify studies that reported severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients on current IBD therapies including 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA), immunomodulators, corticosteroids, biologics, combination therapy, or tofacitinib.RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were identified. Corticosteroids (risk ratio (RR) 1.91 (95% CI 1.25 to 2.91, p=0.003)) and 5-ASA (RR 1.50 (95% CI 1.17 to 1.93, p=0.001)) were associated with increased risk of severe COVID-19 outcomes in patients with IBD patients. However, possible confounders for 5-ASA use were not controlled for. Sub-analysis showed that corticosteroids increased the risk of intensive care unit (ICU) admission but not mortality. Immunomodulators alone (RR 1.18 (95% CI 0.87 to 1.59, p=0.28)) or in combination with anti-TNFs ((RR 0.96 (95% CI 0.80 to 1.15, p=0.63)), tofacitinib (RR 0.81 (95% CI 0.49 to 1.33, p=0.40)) and vedolizumab ((RR 1.02 (95% CI 0.79 to 1.31, p=0.89)) were not associated with severe disease. Anti-TNFs (RR 0.47 (95% CI 0.40 to 0.54, p<0.00001)) and ustekinumab (RR 0.55 (95% CI 0.43 to 0.72, p<0.00001)) were associated with decreased risk of severe COVID-19.CONCLUSION: In patients with IBD, the risk of severe COVID-19 is higher among patients receiving corticosteroids. Corticosteroid use was associated with ICU admission but not mortality. The risk is also higher among patients receiving 5-ASAs. However, patient-level data were lacking and insufficient data existed for meta-regression analyses to adjust for confounding. Vedolizumab, tofacitinib, and immunomodulators alone or in combination with anti-TNF were not associated with severe disease. Anti-TNFs, and ustekinumab were associated with favourable outcomes.",

Studying the genetics, evolution, and neurobiology of acoustic communication requires annotating acoustic signals: segmenting and identifying individual acoustic elements like syllables or sound pulses. To be useful, annotations need to be accurate, robust to noise, and fast.We here introduce DeepAudioSegmenter (DAS), a method that annotates acoustic signals across species based on a deep-learning derived hierarchical presentation of sound. We demonstrate the accuracy, robustness, and speed of DAS using acoustic signals with diverse characteristics from insects, birds, and mammals. DAS comes with a graphical user interface for annotating song, training the network, and for generating and proofreading annotations. The method can be trained to annotate signals from new species with little manual annotation and can be combined with unsupervised methods to discover novel signal types. DAS annotates song with high throughput and low latency for experimental interventions in realtime. Overall, DAS is a universal, versatile, and accessible tool for annotating acoustic communication signals.",

Depending on the brain region studied, distinct effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission have been reported. Here, we used intraperitoneal injections of atRA (10 mg/kg) in adult C57BL/6J mice to study the effects of atRA on excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission in the mouse fascia dentata-a brain region implicated in memory acquisition. No major changes in synaptic transmission were observed in the ventral hippocampus while a significant increase in both spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic current frequencies and synapse numbers were evident in the dorsal hippocampus 6 hr after atRA administration. The intrinsic properties of hippocampal dentate granule cells were not significantly different and hippocampal transcriptome analysis revealed no essential neuronal changes upon atRA treatment. In light of these findings, we tested for the metaplastic effects of atRA, that is, for its ability to modulate synaptic plasticity expression in the absence of major changes in baseline synaptic strength. Indeed, in vivo long-term potentiation (LTP) experiments demonstrated that systemic atRA treatment improves the ability of dentate granule cells to express LTP. The plasticity-promoting effects of atRA were not observed in synaptopodin-deficient mice, therefore, extending our previous results regarding the relevance of synaptopodin in atRA-mediated synaptic strengthening in the mouse prefrontal cortex. Taken together, our data show that atRA mediates synaptopodin-dependent metaplasticity in mouse dentate granule cells.",

Vaccine hesitancy was defined as the response of \"no\" or \"don't know/not sure\" to whether the participant would get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as it became available.RESULTS: The sample comprised 948 participants including 27.7% Whites, 59.6% Blacks, 12.7% Latinx, and 63% female. 32% earned <$20K annually, 60% owned a computer and ~80% had internet access at home. The prevalence of vaccine hesitancy was 68.9% including 62.7%, 74%, and 59.5% among Whites, Blacks, and Latinx, respectively. Between September and December, the largest decline in vaccine hesitancy occurred among Whites (27.5 percentage points), followed by Latinx (17.6) and only 12.0 points among Blacks. 51.2% of respondents reported vaccine safety concerns, 23.7% wanted others to get vaccinated first, and 63.1% would trust health care providers about the COVID-19 vaccine. Factors associated with hesitancy in multivariable logistic regression included being female (OR = 1.90 95%CI [1.36, 2.64]), being Black (OR = 1.68 1.16, 2.45]), calendar month (OR = 0.76 [0.63, 0.92]), safety concerns (OR = 4.28 [3.06, 5.97]), and government distrust (OR = 3.57 [2.26, 5.63]).CONCLUSIONS: This study engaged the community to directly reach underserved minority populations at highest risk of COVID-19 that permitted assessment of vaccine hesitancy (which was much higher than national estimates), driven in part by distrust, and safety concerns.",

We assessed whether strategies to increase downloads of exposure notification apps should emphasize improving the accuracy of the apps in recording contacts and exposures, strengthening privacy protections and/or offering financial incentives to potential users. In a discrete choice experiment with potential app users in the US, financial incentives were more than twice as important in decision-making about app downloads, than privacy protections, and app accuracy. The probability that a potential user would download an exposure notification app increased by 40% when offered a $100 reward to download (relative to a reference scenario in which the app is free). Financial incentives might help exposure notification apps reach uptake levels that improve the effectiveness of contact tracing programs and ultimately enhance efforts to control SARS-CoV-2. Rapid, pragmatic trials of financial incentives for app downloads in real-life settings are warranted.",

We calculated frequencies for work environment, personal protective equipment use, and SARS-CoV-2 testing history. We used generalized linear models to produce unadjusted prevalence ratios (PR) to assess risk factors for SARS-CoV-2 infection.RESULTS: Of the 106 respondents, 43.4% reported frequent close contact with clients; 75% were worried about work-related SARS-CoV-2 infections; 15% reported testing positive. Close contact with clients was associated with testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 (PR 3.97, 95%CI 1.06, 14.93).CONCLUSIONS: Homeless shelter workers may be at risk of being exposed to individuals with COVID-19 during the course of their work. Frequent close contact with clients was associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. Protecting these critical essential workers by implementing mitigation measures and prioritizing for COVID-19 vaccination is imperative during the pandemic.",

A total of 1 531 736 individuals vaccinated with either vaccine between December 21, 2020, and September 19, 2021, were followed up beginning 14 days after receiving the second dose until September 19, 2021.Exposures: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 vaccination.Main Outcomes and Measures: Incident SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-positive nasopharyngeal swab regardless of reason for PCR testing or presence of symptoms. Cumulative incidence was calculated using the Kaplan-Meier estimator method.Results: The BNT162b2-vaccinated cohort comprised 99 226 individuals with and 290 432 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection (median age, 37 years; 68% male). The mRNA-1273-vaccinated cohort comprised 58 096 individuals with and 169 514 matched individuals without prior PCR-confirmed infection (median age, 36 years; 73% male). Among BNT162b2-vaccinated persons, 159 reinfections occurred in those with and 2509 in those without prior infection 14 days or more after dose 2. Among mRNA-1273-vaccinated persons, 43 reinfections occurred in those with and 368 infections in those without prior infection. Cumulative infection incidence among BNT162b2-vaccinated individuals was an estimated 0.15% (95% CI, 0.12%-0.18%) in those with and 0.83% (95% CI, 0.79%-0.87%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio for breakthrough infection with prior infection, 0.18 [95% CI, 0.15-0.21]; P < .001). Cumulative infection incidence among mRNA-1273-vaccinated individuals was an estimated 0.11% (95% CI, 0.08%-0.15%) in those with and 0.35% (95% CI, 0.32%-0.40%) in those without prior infection at 120 days of follow-up (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.35 [95% CI, 0.25-0.48]; P < .001). Vaccinated individuals with prior infection 6 months or more before dose 1 had statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection than those vaccinated less than 6 months before dose 1 (adjusted hazard ratio, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.42-0.92]; P = .02 for BNT162b2 and 0.40 [95% CI, 0.18-0.91]; P = .03 for mRNA-1273 vaccination).Conclusions and Relevance: Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a statistically significantly lower risk for breakthrough infection among individuals receiving the BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 vaccines in Qatar between December 21, 2020, and September 19, 2021.

Patients affected by CRVO and BRVO were progressively recruited, along with an age- and sex-matched control group of healthy subjects. Structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA; 4.5 ? 4.5 mm and 9.0 ? 9.0 mm acquisitions) were performed on all participants in order to assess the relationship between the presence of collateral vessels and final anatomical outcomes - central macular thickness (CMT), foveal avascular zone - and functional outcomes - best corrected visual acuity (BCVA).Results: Fifty-six eyes affected by CRVO and 47 eyes affected by BRVO were included. Baseline LogMAR BCVA was 0.41 � 0.33 LogMAR in CRVO, and 0.39 � 0.25 LogMAR in BRVO (P < 0.01), improving to 0.20 � 0.26 LogMAR in CRVO (P < 0.01), and 0.19 � 0.22 LogMAR in BRVO (P < 0.01). Baseline CMT was 511 � 214 �m in CRVO and 482 � 178 �m in BRVO (P > 0.05), decreasing to 328 � 105 �m (P < 0.01) and 321 � 78 �m in CRVO and BRVO, respectively (P < 0.01). Collateral vessels were detected in 16 of 56 eyes (29%) in CRVO and in 47 of 47 eyes (100%) in BRVO. Their extension was correlated with worse anatomic and visual outcomes. Remarkably, no correlation was found with peripheral capillary nonperfusion and vessel density impairment.Conclusions: The present study demonstrates that collateral vessel extension is associated with worse anatomic and functional outcomes in patients affected by CRVO and BRVO.",

Patient data were retrospectively collected including baseline characteristics and surgical variables. Factors related to revision surgery were analyzed through uni- and multivariate analysis.RESULTS: Thirty-five patients, of whom 54.3% were male, were included. The cyst was diagnosed prenatally in 23 patients (65.7%). Surgery was typically recommended after a mean cyst follow-up of 3.4 � 3.9 months, with a mean age at surgery of 6.1 � 5.1 months. In 54.3% of patients (n = 19), surgery was performed before the age of 6 months. The PFAC was treated purely neuroendoscopically in 57.1% of patients (n = 20), while 28.6% of patients underwent open cyst procedures (n = 10), 5.7% (n = 2) were treated with a shunt, and 8.6% (n = 3) underwent a combined procedure. Additional surgery was required in 31.4% of patients (n = 11; mean 2.36 � 2.11 surgeries per patient). At the last follow-up (61.40 � 55.33 months), no mortality or permanent morbidity was seen; radiological improvement was apparent in 83.9% of the patients. Those patients treated before the age of 6 months (p = 0.09) and who presented before surgery with a stable cyst size that was maintained throughout preoperative monitoring (p = 0.08) showed a trend toward higher revision rates after surgical treatment.CONCLUSIONS: PFACs in infancy may require surgical treatment before the age of 6 months. Navigated endoscopy was a valid surgical option. Overall mortality or permanent morbidity was rare. Additional surgery was required in up to 30% of the patients; younger age and a preoperatively stable cyst might be risk factors for revision surgery.",

In the earlier phases of the emergence of COVID-19, China was the first to impose strict restrictions on movement (lockdown) on January 23rd, 2020. A strategy whose effectiveness in curtailing COVID-19 was yet to be determined. We, therefore, sought to study the impact of the lockdown in reducing the incidence of COVID-19.Methods: Daily cases of COVID-19 that occurred in China which were registered between January 12th and March 30th, 2020, were extracted from the Johns Hopkins CSSE team COVID-19 ArcGIS� dashboards. Daily cases reported were used as data points in the series. Two interrupted series models were run: one with an interruption point of 23 January 2020 (model 1) and the other with a 14-day deferred interruption point of 6th February (model 2). For both models, the magnitude of change (before and after) and linear trend analyses were measured, and �-coefficients reported with 95% confidence interval (CI) for the precision.Results: Seventy-eight data points were used in the analysis. There was an 11% versus a 163% increase in daily cases in models 1 and 2, respectively, in the preintervention periods (p ? 0.001). Comparing the period immediately following the intervention points to the counterfactual, there was a daily increase of 2,746% (p < 0.001) versus a decline of 207% (p = 0.802) in model 2. However, in both scenarios, there was a statistically significant drop in the daily cases predicted for this data and beyond when comparing the preintervention periods and postintervention periods (p < 0.001).Conclusion: There was a significant decrease the COVID-19 daily cases reported in China following the institution of a lockdown, and therefore, lockdown may be used to curtail the burden of COVID-19.",

In adults, one of the most widely used indicators of skeletal age is the Root Dentin Translucency (RDT), mainly through the Lamendin technique, which is used in various Latin American contexts. Recently, Parra et al. (2020) have developed a Bayesian regression model using the Lamendin technique to establish standardized criteria for estimating age-at-death in adults in various forensic contexts. In this study, we evaluate the applicability of this proposal together with the proposal by Lamendin et al. (1992) and Prince and Ubelaker (2002) in Latin American contexts. A sample of single-rooted teeth belonging to 805 individuals from six Latin American countries was used. The results of the three proposals considered were analyzed taking into account factors such as age, sex, origin, and the tooth surface on which the variables were surveyed. Of the factors that would affect the estimates, it was found that the age of the individuals had the greatest influence. However, it was confirmed that the sex and surface of the teeth on which the measurements were taken did not influence the final result. On the other hand, as we expected, the application of the analyzed proposals would also be possible in other forensic contexts, as shown by the results obtained according to the origin. This research expands the FIDB with more information on Latino contexts.",

Moreover, it has been suggested that blood group is also associated with the prevalence and severity of this disease. However, the relationship between the cytokine profile and blood group remains unclear in COVID-19 patients. In this sense, we prospectively recruited 108 COVID-19 patients between March and April 2020 and divided according to ABO blood group. For the analysis of 45 cytokines, plasma samples were collected in the time of admission to hospital ward or intensive care unit and at the sixth day after hospital admission. The results show that there was a risk of more than two times lower of mechanical ventilation or death in patients with blood group O (log rank: p = 0.042). At first time, all statistically significant cytokine levels, except from hepatocyte growth factor, were higher in O blood group patients meanwhile the second time showed a significant drop, between 20% and 40%. In contrast, A/B/AB group presented a maintenance of cytokine levels during time. Hepatocyte growth factor showed a significant association with intubation or mortality risk in non-O blood group patients (OR: 4.229, 95% CI (2.064-8.665), p < 0.001) and also was the only one bad prognosis biomarker in O blood group patients (OR: 8.852, 95% CI (1.540-50.878), p�=�0.015).

To solve this problem, we developed a rodent model by opening the blood-brain barrier (BBB) with low frequency ultrasound, followed by injection of NMO-IgG from NMOSD patients and complement to mice suffering pre-existing neuroinflammation produced by experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In this study, we showed that ultrasound with NMO-IgG and complement caused marked inflammation and demyelination of both spinal cords and optic nerves compared to blank control group, as well as glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and aquaporin-4 (AQP4) loss of spinal cords and optic nerves compared to EAE mice and EAE mice with only BBB opening. In addition, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed optic neuritis with spinal cord lesions. We further demonstrated eye segregation defects in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of these NMOSD mice.",

Our comprehensive integrative analyses of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data from four published studies, in patients with mild/moderate and severe infections, indicate a robust expansion and mobilization of the innate immune response and highlight mechanisms by which low-density neutrophils and megakaryocytes play a crucial role in the cross talk between lymphoid and myeloid lineages. We also document a marked reduction of several lymphoid cell types, particularly natural killer cells, mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, and gamma-delta T (��T) cells, and a robust expansion and extensive heterogeneity within plasmablasts, especially in severe COVID-19 patients. We confirm the changes in cellular abundances for certain immune cell types within a new patient cohort. While the cellular heterogeneity in COVID-19 extends across cells in both lineages, we consistently observe certain subsets respond more potently to interferon type I (IFN-I) and display increased cellular abundances across the spectrum of severity, as compared with healthy subjects. However, we identify these expanded subsets to have a more muted response to IFN-I within severe disease compared to non-severe disease. Our analyses further highlight an increased aggregation potential of the myeloid subsets, particularly monocytes, in COVID-19. Finally, we provide detailed mechanistic insights into the interaction between lymphoid and myeloid lineages, which contributes to the multisystemic phenotype of COVID-19, distinguishing severe from non-severe responses.",

Here, we quantify 23 immune cell populations in 141 samples from children and adults with mild COVID-19 and their PCR-negative close household contacts at acute and convalescent time points. Children with COVID-19 displayed marked reductions in myeloid cells during infection, most prominent in children under the age of five. Recovery from infection in both children and adults was characterised by the generation of CD8 TCM and CD4 TCM up to 9 weeks post infection. SARS-CoV-2-exposed close contacts also had immunological changes over time despite no evidence of confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection on PCR testing. This included an increase in low-density neutrophils during convalescence in both exposed children and adults, as well as increases in CD8 TCM and CD4 TCM in exposed adults. In comparison to children with other common respiratory viral infections, those with COVID-19 had a greater change in innate and T cell-mediated immune responses over time. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the immune response during and after recovery from COVID-19 in both children and adults.",

In March 2021, the second wave of the pandemic began with a new strain of COVID-19, which was more dangerous for some countries, including India, recording 400,000 new cases daily and more than 4,000 deaths per day. This pandemic has overloaded the medical sector, especially radiology. Deep-learning techniques have been used to reduce the burden on hospitals and assist physicians for accurate diagnoses. In our study, two models of deep learning, ResNet-50 and AlexNet, were introduced to diagnose X-ray datasets collected from many sources. Each network diagnosed a multiclass (four classes) and a two-class dataset. The images were processed to remove noise, and a data augmentation technique was applied to the minority classes to create a balance between the classes. The features extracted by convolutional neural network (CNN) models were combined with traditional Gray-level Cooccurrence Matrix (GLCM) and Local Binary Pattern (LBP) algorithms in a 1-D vector of each image, which produced more representative features for each disease. Network parameters were tuned for optimum performance. The ResNet-50 network reached accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 95%, 94.5%, 98%, and 97.10%, respectively, with the multiclasses (COVID-19, viral pneumonia, lung opacity, and normal), while it reached accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of 99%, 98%, 98%, and 97.51%, respectively, with the binary classes (COVID-19 and normal).",

A multicentre, cross-sectional study was conducted involving all primary health care corporation-registered patients (2485 patients) enrolled over a 1-month period during the peak of the 2020 pandemic wave in Qatar. These patients had reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction-confirmed COVID-19 and underwent chest radiography within 72 hours of the swab test. A positive result on reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction was the gold standard for diagnosing COVID-19. The sensitivity of chest radiography was calculated. The airspace opacities were mostly distributed in the peripheral and lower lung zones, and most of the patients had bilateral involvement. Pleural effusion was detected in some cases. The risk of having positive chest X-ray findings increased with age, Southeast Asian nationality, fever, or a history of fever and diarrhoea. Patients with cardiac disease, obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and chronic kidney disease were at a higher risk of having positive chest X-ray findings. There was a statistically significant increase in the mean serum albumin, white blood cell count, neutrophil count, and serum C-reactive protein, hepatic enzymes, and total bilirubin with an increase in the radiographic severity score.",

Although usually not life-threatening, there can be consequences following migration of the object or perforation of the large bowel. This study looks at the incidence of removal of foreign objects from the rectum over the last decade and the financial burden it presents to the NHS.METHODS: Hospital Episode Statistics for 2010-2019 were used to calculate the number of rectal foreign bodies that required removal in hospital. Data for age groups and genders have been compared.RESULTS: A total of 3,500 rectal foreign bodies were removed over the course of 9 years. Males accounted for 85.1% of rectal foreign bodies whilst 14.9% were females. This equates to 348 bed-days per annum. Admission peaks were observed in the second and fifth decades of life.CONCLUSION: This study shows that the incidence of rectal foreign bodies is higher in men and has been increasing over the period studied. Most foreign bodies can be removed trans-anally with the use of anaesthesia, with only a small proportion of patients requiring hospital stay over 24 hours (mean length of stay = 24 hours). Nearly 400 rectal foreign body removals are performed each year with an annual cost of �338,819, illustrating the effect this has on NHS resources.",

The aim of this study was to analyse a case series of patients with forklift-related injuries over 7 years at a level 1 major trauma centre in the UK and present their patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) with long-term follow-up. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the largest case series study in the UK describing forklift injuries.METHODS: Retrospective case note analysis of 19 patients over 7 years. Data including demographics, injury mechanism, pattern of injury, management, length of hospital stay, number of operations and complications were extracted from the notes. We used 'Enneking score' as a validated tool for PROMs.RESULTS: Seventeen men and two women with mean age of 47 years; 20% had bilateral injuries and 34% had multi-level fractures. The mean number of theatre sessions was 5.21, while the mean length of hospital stay was 30.10 days. There was one mortality. Twelve patients (63%) required reconstruction with free tissue transfer, with one flap failure. The mean long-term Enneking percentage score was 57.33%. The mean Enneking score for patients in this study is lower than our institute's score for Gustilo 3B, highlighting the gravity of these injuries.CONCLUSION: Forklifts can cause grave injuries with massive energy transfer. This study highlights the seriousness of those injuries, thus guiding patient counselling and optimising planning of management.",

We focused on receptors involved in interactions between immune cells and virus-infected cells. We found that the diversity of receptor repertoires on natural killer (NK) cells was negatively correlated with the viral clearance rate. In addition, NK subsets expressing the receptor DNAM1 were increased in patients who more rapidly recovered from infection. Ex vivo functional studies revealed that NK subpopulations with high DNAM1 expression had cytolytic activities in response to target cell stimulation. We also found that SARS-CoV-2 infection induced the expression of CD155 and nectin-4, ligands of DNAM1 and its paired coinhibitory receptor TIGIT, which counterbalanced the cytolytic activities of NK cells. Collectively, our results link the cytolytic immune responses of NK cells to the clearance of SARS-CoV-2 and show that the DNAM1 pathway modulates host-pathogen interactions during SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

However, since not every HD patient is suitable for telehealth, it is important to differentiate who can be seen virtually from who should remain as in-person. Unfortunately, there are no clinical guidelines on how to evaluate HD patients for telehealth eligibility.OBJECTIVE: To standardize the teleneurology selection process in HD by implementing a screening tool that accounts for patient-specific factors.METHODS: We organized various indications and contraindications to teleneurology into a flowchart. If any indications or contraindications were met, patients were assigned to telehealth or maintained as in-person, respectively. If no indications or contraindications were met, patients were given the option of telehealth or in-person for their upcoming appointments. In two implementation cycles, we tested this screening tool among all HD patients scheduled for clinic visits, aided by chart review and phone interview.RESULTS: In a cohort of 81 patients, telehealth acceptance among eligible patients increased from 45.0%to 83.3%. Frequency of telehealth visits increased from a pre-intervention baseline of 12.8%to 28.2%.CONCLUSION: Teleneurology utilization among HD patients more than doubled across our study. Our intervention promotes consistency and patient-centeredness in HD clinical care and streamlines the overall telehealth selection process. Future studies can seek to reduce telehealth no-shows and also evaluate the utility of the motor and psychiatric criteria included in our screening tool.",

A total of 1234 patients were recruited and followed up for a median duration of 91 days (IQR: 45-181 days). Among them, 495 (40.1%) had persistent symptoms post-discharge or recovery. In 223 (18.1%) patients, the symptoms resolved within four weeks; 150 (12.1%) patients had symptoms till 12 weeks, and 122 (9.9%) patients had symptoms beyond 12 weeks of diagnosis/symptom-onset of COVID-19. Most common symptoms included myalgia (10.9%), fatigue (5.5%), shortness of breath (6.1%), cough (2.1%), insomnia (1.4%), mood disturbances (0.48%) and anxiety (0.6%). Patients who were hospitalized were more likely to report fatigue as a feature of long COVID. Hypothyroidism (OR: 4.13, 95% CI: 2.2-7.6, p-value < 0.001) and hypoxia (SpO2 ? 93%) (OR: 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1-2.4, p-value 0.012) were identified as risk factors for long COVID sequelae. In conclusion, long COVID symptoms were common (22%), and 9.9% had the post COVID-19 syndrome. Myalgias, fatigue and dyspnoea were common symptoms. Patients with hypothyroidism and hypoxia during acute illness were at higher risk of long COVID.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate if SARS-CoV-2 is detectable in vaginal swabs and whether antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 are present in maternal and umbilical cord blood of pregnant women with confirmed SARS-CoV-2.MATERIAL AND METHODS: A single-unit prospective cohort study in Denmark including pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection confirmed by a pharyngeal swab between August 20, 2020, and March 1, 2021, who gave birth during the same period. All patients admitted to the maternity ward and antepartum clinic were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A maternal blood sample and vaginal swabs were collected at inclusion. If included antepartum, these samples were repeated intrapartum when an umbilical cord blood sample was also collected. Swabs were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 and blood samples were analyzed for SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies. Placental and neonatal swabs as well as placental histopathological examinations were performed on clinical indications.RESULTS: We included 28 women, of whom four had serious maternal or fetal outcomes including one case of neonatal death. Within the first 8�days after confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, SARS-CoV-2 was detectable in two vaginal swabs (2/28) and SARS-CoV-2 antibodies were detected in 1 of 13 women. From 16�days after confirmed infection, antibodies were observed in 19 of 21 of women. Antibodies in cord blood were not detected during the first 16�days after confirmed infection (n�=�7). However, from 26�days, antibodies were present in 16 of 17 cord blood samples of seropositive mothers. Placental examination in two cases of severe fetal outcomes preceded by reduced fetal movements revealed SARS-CoV-2 in swabs and severe histopathological abnormalities.CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 was detected in only 2 of 28 vaginal swabs within 8�days after confirmed infection in pregnant women. Our data suggest that maternal seroconversion occurs between days 8 and 16, whereas antibodies in cord blood of seropositive mothers were present in the majority from 26�days after confirmed infection. Additional data are needed regarding timing of seroconversion for the mother and appearance of antibodies in cord blood.",

This study aimed to ascertain whether routine laboratory tests are necessary after elective TSA.METHODS: A retrospective review of electronic records was completed for 274 patients that underwent TSA in the past six years. In total, 216 patients were eligible for analysis. The primary outcome was intervention rate for abnormal postoperative blood tests. Secondary outcomes were hospital length of stay (LOS), and readmissions at 30 and 90 days.RESULTS: In total, 193 patients underwent 216 TSAs; 72% were female, and the mean cohort age was 78 � 7.2 years. Overall, 136 patients (63%) had an abnormal postoperative blood test, however; only 8 (3.7%) required intervention. The average postoperative drop in haemoglobin (Hb) was 19g/l. In four patients (1.8%) Hb levels dropped to < 80g/l; however, only two (0.9%) were symptomatic and received a red blood cell transfusion. Six patients (2.8%) developed acute kidney injury and did not require haemofiltration. The mean LOS was 3.2 � 2.9 days. Five patients (2.3%) were readmitted within 30 days and six patients (2.8%) within 90 days. Univariate analysis only showed association between patients with abnormal creatinine and LOS (p < 0.05), and all of these patients had raised preoperative creatinine levels.CONCLUSIONS: Routine postoperative blood tests are not required as they did not change the clinical outcome in this cohort or the readmission rate, causing unnecessary costs. It is recommended to request postoperative blood tests for patients with raised preoperative creatinine levels.",

To date there are no data on the attitudes and behaviours of surgeons towards climate change, or perceived barriers towards sustainable practice.METHODS: We invited surgeons and surgical trainees in the UK and Ireland to participate in an online survey (developed in accordance with the CHERRIES checklist) conducted between June and November 2020 and disseminated via the Royal College of Surgeons of England, Edinburgh and Ireland, the Association of Surgeons in Training and through local communication.RESULTS: We received 130 responses, across 14 surgical specialties. The majority of respondents (122/130; 94%) were concerned about the threat of climate change. Most respondents had instigated more sustainable practices in their personal lives (113/130; 87%) and, to a lesser extent, at work (73/130; 56%). Surgeons were willing to make changes to their clinical practice (107/130; 82%), but the main perceived barrier to improving sustainability was a lack of leadership (92/130; 70%). Surgeons welcomed greater leadership and guidance from national bodies (118/130; 91%) and more monitoring and regulation (113/130; 87%).CONCLUSIONS: The surgeons who responded to our survey are concerned about climate change and willing to engage in efforts to transition to more sustainable practice, but would welcome greater support, guidance and leadership.",

Methods: We developed a metric of the potential for tissue infected with SARS-CoV-2 (\"TPSI\") based on ACE2 and TMPRSS2 transcript levels and compared TPSI levels between tumor and matched normal tissues across 11 tumor types. For further analysis of HNSC, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), functional analysis, and single sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were conducted to investigate TPSI-relevant biological processes and their relationship with the immune landscape. TPSI-related factors were identified from clinical and mutational domains, followed by lasso regression to determine their relative effects on TPSI levels. Results: TPSI levels in tumors were generally lower than in the normal tissues. In HNSC, the genes highly associated with TPSI were enriched in viral entry-related processes, and TPSI levels were positively correlated with both eosinophils and T helper 17 (Th17) cell infiltration. Furthermore, the site of onset, human papillomaviruses (HPV) status, and nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 1 (NSD1) mutations were identified as the most important factors shaping TPSI levels. Conclusions: This study identified the infection risk of SARS-CoV-2 between tumor and normal tissues, and provided evidence for the risk stratification of HNSC.",

The early use of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) for light and ordinary patients, can rapidly improve symptoms, shorten hospitalization days and reduce severe cases transformed from light and normal. Many TCM formulas and products have a wide application in treating infectious and non-infectious diseases. Polygonum cuspidatum Sieb. et Zucc. (P. cuspidatum), is an important Traditional Chinese Medicine with actions of clearing away heat and eliminating dampness, draining the gallbladder to relieve jaundice, removing blood stasis to alleviate pain, resolving phlegm and arrest cough. In the search for anti-SARS-CoV-2, P. cuspidatum was recommended as as a therapeutic drug of COVID-19 pneumonia.In this study, we aimed to identifies P. cuspidatum is the potential broad-spectrum inhibitor for the treatment of coronaviruses infections. Methods: In the present study , we infected human malignant embryonal rhabdomyoma (RD) cells with the OC43 strain of the coronavirus, which represent an alternative model for SARS-CoV-2 and then employed the cell viability assay kit for the antiviral activity. We combined computer aided virtual screening to predicte the binding site and employed Surface plasmon resonance analysis (SPR) to comfirm the interaction between drugs and coronavirus. We employed fluorescence resonance energy transfer technology to identify drug's inhibition in the proteolytic activity of 3CLpro and Plpro. Results: Based on our results, polydatin and resveratrol derived from P. cuspidatum significantly suppressed HCoV-OC43 replication. 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values of polydatin inhibited SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and Plpro, MERS Mpro and Plpro were 18.66, 125, 14.6 and 25.42 �m, respectively. IC50 values of resveratrol inhibited SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and Plpro, MERS Mpro and Plpro were 29.81 ,60.86, 16.35 and19.04 �M, respectively. Finally, SPR assay confirmed that polydatin and resveratrol had high affinity to SARS-CoV-2, SARS-CoV 3Clpro, MERS-CoV 3Clpro and PLpro protein. Conclusions: we identified the antiviral activity of flavonoids polydatin and resveratrol on RD cells. Polydatin and resveratrol were found to be specific and selective inhibitors for SARS-CoV-2, 3CLpro and PLpro, viral cysteine proteases. In summary, this study identifies P. cuspidatum as the potential broad-spectrum inhibitor for the treatment of coronaviruses infections.",

This study quantifies wear performance of tibial inserts in a large and diverse series of retrieved TKAs to evaluate the effect of factors related to the patient, knee design, and bearing material on tibial insert wear performance.METHODS: An institutional review board-approved retrieval archive was surveyed for modular PE tibial inserts over a range of in vivo duration (mean 58 months (0 to 290)). Five knee designs, totalling 1,585 devices, were studied. Insert wear was estimated from measured thickness change using a previously published method. Linear regression statistical analyses were used to test association of 12 patient and implant design variables with calculated wear rate.RESULTS: Five patient-specific variables and seven implant-specific variables were evaluated for significant association with lower insert wear rate. Six were significant when controlling for other factors: greater patient age, female sex, shorter duration in vivo, polished tray, highly cross-linked PE (HXLPE), and constrained knee design.CONCLUSION: This study confirmed that knee wear rate increased with duration in vivo. Older patients and females had significantly lower wear rates. Polished modular tibial tray surfaces, HXLPE, and constrained TKA designs were device design factors associated with significantly reduced wear rate.

Secondary objectives were to assess its pain and function subscales, and to identify independent predictors for patients achieving a postoperative ceiling score following shoulder arthroplasty.METHODS: Secondary database analysis of the National Joint Registry (NJR), which included 48,270 patients undergoing shoulder arthroplasty, was conducted. The primary outcome measure was the OSS. Secondary outcome measures were the OSS-Function Component Subscale and OSS-Pain Component Subscale. Floor and ceiling effects were considered to be present if > 15% of patients scored either the lowest or highest possible score. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent predictors for scoring the highest possible OSS score postoperatively.RESULTS: Preoperatively, 1% of patients achieved the lowest possible OSS score (0) and 0.4% of patients achieved the highest possible score (48). Postoperatively, < 1% of patients achieved the lowest score at all timepoints, but the percentage achieving the highest score at six months was 8.3%, at three years 16.9%, and at five years 17%. Male patients, those aged between 60 and 89 years, and those undergoing an anatomical total shoulder arthroplasty (ATSA) were more likely to contribute to the ceiling effect seen in the OSS questionnaire. Pain and function subscales exhibited greater ceiling effects at three years and five years when compared with the overall OSS questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis showed that sex, procedure type, and preoperative OSS score were independent predictors for scoring the highest possible OSS at years.CONCLUSION: Based on NJR patient-reported outcome measures data, the OSS does not exhibit a ceiling effect at six months, but does at three years and five years, in part due to outcome scores of ATSA. Preoperative OSS, age, male sex, and ATSA are independent predictors of achieving a ceiling score. Cite this article: Bone Joint J�2021;103-B(11):1717-1724.",

Arthroscopic findings were assessed according to the International Cartilage Repair Society (ICRS) Cartilage Repair Assessment (CRA) grading system. Patients were divided into two groups based on the presence of normal or nearly normal quality cartilage in the medial femoral condyle: good (second-look arthroscopic) status (ICRS grade I or II; n = 70), and poor (second-look arthroscopic) status (ICRS grade III or IV; n = 85) groups at the time of second-look arthroscopy. Clinical outcomes were assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) score, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC), and 36-Item Short Form survey.RESULTS: Significant improvements in all clinical outcome categories were found between the preoperative and second-look arthroscopic assessments in both groups (p < 0.001). At the latest follow-up, the mean IKDC and WOMAC scores in the good status group further improved compared with those at the time of second-look arthroscopic surgery (p < 0.001), which was not shown in the poor status group. The mean IKDC (good status, 72.8 (SD 12.5); poor status, 64.7 (SD 12.1); p = 0.002) and mean WOMAC scores (good status, 15.7 (SD 10.8); poor status, 21.8 (SD 13.6); p = 0.004) significantly differed between both groups at the latest follow-up. Moreover, significant correlations were observed between ICRS CRA grades and IKDC scores (negative correlation; p < 0.001) and WOMAC scores (positive correlation; p < 0.001) at the latest follow-up. Good cartilage status was found more frequently in knees with the desired range of 2� to 6� valgus correction than in those with corrections outside this range (p = 0.019).CONCLUSION: Second-look arthroscopic cartilage status correlated with clinical outcomes after MOHTO at intermediate-term follow-up, despite the relatively small clinical differences between groups.

As treatment improves, the number of patients who need surgical intervention is increasing. Identifying patients with a shorter life expectancy would allow surgical intervention with more durable reconstructions to be targeted to those most likely to benefit. While previous scoring systems have focused on surgical and oncological factors, there is a need to consider comorbidities and the physiological state of the patient, as these will also affect outcome. The primary aim of this study was to create a scoring system to estimate survival time in patients with bony metastases and to determine which factors may adversely affect this.METHODS: This was a retrospective study which included all patients who had presented for surgery with metastatic bone disease. The data collected included patient, surgical, and oncological variables. Univariable and multivariable analysis identified which factors were associated with a survival time of less than six months and less than one year. A model to predict survival based on these factors was developed using Cox regression.RESULTS: A total of 164 patients were included with a median survival time of 1.6 years (interquartile range 0.5 to 3.1) after surgery. On multivariable analysis, a higher American Society of Anesthesiologists grade (p < 0.001), a high white cell count (p = 0.002), hyponatraemia (p = 0.001), a preoperative resting heart rate of > 100 bpm (p = 0.052), and the type of primary cancer (p = 0.026) remained significant predictors of reduced survival time. The predictive model developed showed good discrimination and calibration to predict both six- and 12-month survival in patients with metastatic bone disease.CONCLUSION: In addition to surgical and oncological factors, the level of comorbidity and physiological state of the patient has a significant impact on survival in patients with metastatic bone disease. These factors should be considered when assessing the appropriateness of surgical intervention. This is the first study to examine other patient factors alongside surgical and oncological data to identify a relationship between these and survival.

A total of 197 patients were randomized for either ODR (retaining the syndesmotic screw unless there were complaints warranting removal) or RR (screw removed at eight to 12 weeks after syndesmotic fixation), of whom 152 completed the study. The primary outcome was functional outcome at 12 months after screw placement, measured by the Olerud-Molander Ankle Score (OMAS).RESULTS: There were 152 patients included in final analysis (RR = 73; ODR = 79). Of these, 59.2% were male (n = 90), and the mean age was 46.9 years (SD 14.6). Median OMAS at 12 months after syndesmotic fixation was 85 (interquartile range (IQR) 60 to 95) for RR and 80 (IQR 65 to 100) for ODR. The noninferiority test indicated that the observed effect size was significantly within the equivalent bounds of -10 and 10 scale points (p < 0.001) for both the intention-to-treat and per-protocol, meaning that ODR was not inferior to RR. There were significantly more complications in the RR group (12/73) than in the ODR group (1/79) (p = 0.007).CONCLUSION: ODR of the syndesmotic screw is not inferior to routine removal when it comes to functional outcome. Combined with the high complication rate of screw removal, this offers a strong argument to adopt on demand removal as standard practice of care after syndesmotic screw fixation.

Our objective was to analyze femoral morphology in PD patients at skeletal maturity to assess where the LLD originates, and evaluate the effect of contralateral epiphysiodesis for length equalization on proximal and subtrochanteric femoral lengths.METHODS: All patients treated for PD in our institution between January 2013 and June 2020 were reviewed retrospectively. Patients with unilateral PD, LLD of ? 5 mm, and long-leg standing radiographs at skeletal maturity were included. Total leg length, femoral and tibial length, articulotrochanteric distance (ATD), and subtrochanteric femoral length were compared between PD side and the unaffected side. Furthermore, we compared leg length measurements between patients who did and who did not have a contralateral epiphysiodesis.RESULTS: Overall, 79 patients were included, of whom 21 underwent contralateral epiphysiodesis for leg length correction. In the complete cohort, the mean LLD was 1.8 cm (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.5 to 2.0), mean ATD difference was 1.8 cm (95% CI -2.1 to -1.9), and mean subtrochanteric difference was -0.2 cm (95% CI -0.4 to 0.1). In the epiphysiodesis group, the mean LLD before epiphysiodesis was 2.7 cm (95% CI 1.3 to 3.4) and 1.3 cm (95% CI -0.5 to 3.8) at skeletal maturity. In the nonepiphysiodesis group the mean LLD was 2.0 cm (95% CI 0.5 to 5.1; p = 0.016). The subtrochanteric region on the PD side was significantly longer at skeletal maturity in the epiphysiodesis group compared to the nonepiphysiodesis group (-1.0 cm (95% CI -2.4 to 0.6) vs 0.1 cm (95% CI -1.0 to 2.1); p < 0.001).CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that LLD after PD originates from the proximal segment only. In patients who had contralateral epiphysiodesis to balance leg length, this is achieved by creating a difference in subtrochanteric length. Arthroplasty surgeons need to be aware that shortening of the proximal femur segment in PD patients may be misleading, as the ipsilateral subtrochanteric length in these patients can be longer. Therefore, we strongly advise long-leg standing films for THA planning in PD patients in order to avoid inadvertently lengthening the limb. Cite this article: Bone Joint J�2021;103-B(11):1736-1741.",

Vancomycin with an aminoglycoside provides antimicrobial cover for most organisms isolated from acute PJI after TKA. However, the intra-articular doses required to achieve sustained therapeutic intra-articular levels while remaining below toxic serum levels is unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine the intra-articular and serum levels of vancomycin and tobramycin over the first 24 hours postoperatively after intra-articular administration in primary cementless TKA.METHODS: A prospective cohort study was performed. Patients were excluded if they had poor renal function, known allergic reaction to vancomycin or tobramycin, received intravenous vancomycin, or were scheduled for same-day discharge. All patients received 600 mg tobramycin and 1 g of vancomycin powder suspended in 25 cc of normal saline and injected into the joint after closure of the arthrotomy. Serum from peripheral venous blood and drain fluid samples were collected at one, four, and 24 hours postoperatively. All concentrations are reported in �g per ml.RESULTS: A total of 22 patients were included in final analysis. At one, four, and 24 hours postoperatively, mean (95% confidence interval (CI)) serum concentrations were 2.4 (0.7 to 4.1), 5.0 (3.1 to 6.9), and 4.8 (2.8 to 6.9) for vancomycin and 4.9 (3.4 to 6.3), 7.0 (5.8 to 8.2), and 1.3 (0.8 to 1.8) for tobramycin; intra-articular concentrations were 1,900.6 (1,492.5 to 2,308.8), 717.9 (485.5 to 950.3), and 162.2 (20.5 to 304.0) for vancomycin and 2,105.3 (1,389.9 to 2,820.6), 403.2 (266.6 to 539.7), and 98.8 (0 to 206.5) for tobramycin.CONCLUSION: Intra-articular administration of 1 g of vancomycin and 600 mg of tobramycin as a solution after closure of the arthrotomy in primary cementless TKA achieves therapeutic intra-articular concentrations over the first 24 hours postoperatively and does not reach sustained toxic levels in peripheral blood.

Anterior coverage (AC), posterior coverage (PC), lateral centre-edge angle (LCEA), acetabular inclination (AI), sharp angle (SA), pelvic tilt (PT), retroversion index (RI), femoroepiphyseal acetabular roof (FEAR) index, femoroepiphyseal horizontal angle (FEHA), leg length discrepancy (LLD), and pelvic obliquity (PO) were analyzed using both Hip2Norm software and PACS-derived measurements where applicable.RESULTS: Analysis of supine and standing radiographs resulted in significant variation for measurements of PT (p < 0.001) and AC (p = 0.005). The variation in PT correlated with the variation in AC in a limited number of patients (R2 = 0.378; p = 0.012).CONCLUSION: The significant variation in PT and AC between supine and standing radiographs suggests that it may benefit surgeons to have both radiographs when planning surgical correction of hip dysplasia. We also recommend using PACS-derived measurements of AI and SA due to the poor interobserver error on Hip2Norm. Cite this article: Bone Joint J�2021;103-B(11):1662-1668.",

The contribution of an abnormal PI to hip osteoarthritis (OA) remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to investigate the relationship between PI and hip OA, and the difference in PI between hip OA without anatomical abnormalities (primary OA) and hip OA with developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH-OA).METHODS: In this study, 100 patients each of primary OA, DDH-OA, and control subjects with no history of hip disease were included. CT images were used to measure PI, sagittal femoral head coverage, � angle, and acetabular anteversion. PI was also subdivided into three categories: high PI (larger than 64.0�), medium PI (42.0� to 64.0�), and low PI (less than 42.0�). The anterior centre edge angles, posterior centre edge angles, and total sagittal femoral head coverage were measured. The correlations between PI and sagittal femoral head coverage, � angle, and acetabular anteversion were examined.RESULTS: No significant difference in PI was observed between the three groups. There was no significant difference between the groups in terms of the category distribution of PI. The DDH-OA group had lower mean sagittal femoral head coverage than the other groups. There were no significant correlations between PI and other anatomical factors, including sagittal femoral head coverage, � angle, and acetabular anteversion.CONCLUSION: No associations were found between mean PI values or PI categories and hip OA. Furthermore, there was no difference in PI between patients with primary OA and DDH-OA. From our evaluation, we found no evidence of PI being an independent factor associated with the development of hip OA. Cite this article: Bone Joint J�2021;103-B(11):1656-1661.",

We investigated the risk factors for resection and re-revisions, and assessed complications and subsequent re-revisions.METHODS: In this single-centre, case-control study, 57 patients who underwent one-stage revision arthroplasty for PJI of the hip and required resection of the proximal femur between 2009 and 2018 were identified. The control group consisted of 57 patients undergoing one-stage revision without bony resection. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify any correlation with resection and the risk factors for re-revisions. Rates of all-causes re-revision, reinfection, and instability were compared between groups.RESULTS: Patients who required resection of the proximal femur were found to have a higher all-cause re-revision rate (29.8% vs 10.5%; p = 0.018), largely due to reinfection (15.8% vs 0%; p = 0.003), and dislocation (8.8% vs 10.5%; p = 0.762), and showed higher rate of in-hospital wound haematoma requiring aspiration or evacuation (p = 0.013), and wound revision (p = 0.008). The use of of dual mobility components/constrained liner in the resection group was higher than that of controls (94.7% vs 36.8%; p < 0.001). The presence and removal of additional metal hardware (odds ratio (OR) = 7.2), a sinus tract (OR 4), ten years' time interval between primary implantation and index infection (OR 3.3), and previous hip revision (OR 1.4) increased the risk of proximal femoral resection. A sinus tract (OR 9.2) and postoperative dislocation (OR 281.4) were associated with increased risk of subsequent re-revisions.CONCLUSION: Proximal femoral resection during one-stage revision hip arthroplasty for PJI may be required to reduce the risk of of recurrent or further infection. Patients with additional metalware needing removal or transcortical sinus tracts and chronic osteomyelitis are particularly at higher risk of needing proximal femoral excision. However, radical resection is associated with higher surgical complications and increased re-revision rates. The use of constrained acetabular liners and dual mobility components maintained an acceptable dislocation rate. These results, including identified risk factors, may aid in preoperative planning, patient consultation and consent, and intraoperative decision-making.

A cohort of 224,874 cemented acetabular components were included. The effect of acetabular component geometry on the risk of revision for instability or for loosening was investigated using log-binomial regression adjusting for age, sex, American Society of Anesthesiologists grade, indication, side, institution type, operating surgeon grade, surgical approach, polyethylene crosslinking, and prosthetic head size. A competing risk survival analysis was performed with the competing risks being revision for other indications or death.RESULTS: The distribution of acetabular component geometries was: LPW 81.2%; hooded 18.7%; and offset reorientating 0.1%. There were 3,313 (1.5%) revision THAs performed, of which 815 (0.4%) were for instability and 838 (0.4%) were for loosening. Compared to the LPW group, the adjusted subhazard ratio of revision for instability in the hooded group was 2.31 (p < 0.001) and 4.12 (p = 0.047) in the offset reorientating group. Likewise, the subhazard ratio of revision for loosening was 2.65 (p < 0.001) in the hooded group and 13.61 (p < 0.001) in the offset reorientating group. A time-varying subhazard ratio of revision for instability (hooded vs LPW) was found, being greatest within the first three months.CONCLUSION: This registry-based study confirms a significantly higher risk of revision after cemented THA for instability and for loosening when a hooded or offset reorientating acetabular component is used, compared to a LPW component. Further research is required to clarify if certain patients benefit from the use of hooded or offset reorientating components, but we recommend caution when using such components in routine clinical practice.

However, there are currently few long-term studies on the complications of AFFs and factors affecting them. Therefore, we attempted to investigate the outcomes, complications, and risk factors for complication through mid-term follow-up of more than three years.METHODS: From January 2003 to January 2016, 305 patients who underwent surgery for AFFs at six hospitals were enrolled. After exclusion, a total of 147 patients were included with a mean age of 71.6 years (48 to 89) and 146 of whom were female. We retrospectively evaluated medical records, and reviewed radiographs to investigate the fracture site, femur bowing angle, presence of delayed union or nonunion, contralateral AFFs, and peri-implant fracture. A statistical analysis was performed to identify the significance of associated factors.RESULTS: The mean follow-up period was 70.2 months (36 to 191). There were 146 AFFs (99.3%) in female patients and the mean age was 71.6 years (48 to 89). The AFFs were located in the subtrochanter and shaft in 52 cases (35.4%) and 95 (64.6%), respectively. The preoperative mean anterior/lateral femoral bowing angles were 10.5� (SD 5.7�)/6.1� (SD 6.2�). The postoperative mean anterior/lateral bowing values were changed by 8.7� (SD 5.4�)/4.6� (SD 5.9�). Bisphosphonates had been used contemporarily in 115 AFFs (78.2%) for a mean of 52.4 months (1 to 204; SD 45.5) preoperatively. Nailing was performed in 133 AFFs (90.5%), and union was obtained at a mean of 23.6 weeks (7 to 85). Delayed union occurred in 41 (27.9%), and nonunion occurred in 13 (8.8%). Contralateral AFF occurred in 79 patients (53.7%), and the use of a bisphosphonate significantly influenced the occurrence of contralateral AFFs (p = 0.019). Peri-implant fractures occurred in a total of 13 patients (8.8%), and a significant increase was observed in cases with plating (p = 0.021) and high grade of postoperative anterolateral bowing (p = 0.044).CONCLUSION: The use of a bisphosphonate was found to be a risk factor for contralateral AFF, and high-grade postoperative anterolateral bowing and plate fixation significantly increased the occurrence of peri-implant fractures. Long-term follow-up studies on the bilaterality of AFFs and peri-implant fractures are warranted. Cite this article: Bone Joint J�2021;103-B(11):1648-1655.",

Additionally, the blast cells dropped to only 3% and 0% in the bone marrow aspirates of those two cases, respectively, after it was 30% in both cases at diagnosis.CONCLUSION: The immune response that emerged against COVID-19 infection could potentially produce anti-tumor immunity in some patients, or the virus may act as an oncolytic virus. However, further investigations are required to explain this phenomenon, which may help in finding a possible new targeted therapy for these cases.",

The study estimated a prevalence of 9 to 10 per 100,000 adults in 2020 across all six countries (disease severity split: 34% mild, 32% moderate, 33% severe (due to rounding up some values might not sum up to 100%).RESULTS: Physician feedback showed that most patients with ITP (60%) received first-line treatment or were monitored by their physician; ?75% of patients relapsed within 3-4 months. Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists (TPO-RAs) and rituximab were used to achieve disease stabilization in patients who relapse; patients could switch to an alternative TPO-RA to control symptoms, manage side-effects or improve adherence. The costs of rescue therapies and hospital services (e.g. surgery and admissions) accounted for the majority of healthcare resources to manage bleeding events.CONCLUSION: Physicians would welcome earlier use of TPO-RAs to help maintain long-term control of ITP bleeds and potentially reduce both hospitalization and therapy costs.",

The aim of this study was to investigate the epidemiology, risk factors and outcomes of AKI in patients with COVID-19 in a large UK tertiary centre.METHODS: We analysed data of consecutive adults admitted with a laboratory-confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 across two sites of a hospital in London, UK, from 1st January to 13th May 2020.RESULTS: Of the 1248 inpatients included, 487 (39%) experienced AKI (51% stage 1, 13% stage 2, and 36% stage 3). The weekly AKI incidence rate gradually increased to peak at week 5 (3.12 cases/100 patient-days), before reducing to its nadir (0.83 cases/100 patient-days) at the end the study period (week 10). Among AKI survivors, 84.0% had recovered renal function to pre-admission levels before discharge and none required on-going renal replacement therapy (RRT). Pre-existing renal impairment [odds ratio (OR) 3.05, 95%CI 2.24-4,18; p < �0.0001], and inpatient diuretic use (OR 1.79, 95%CI 1.27-2.53; p < �0.005) were independently associated with a higher risk for AKI. AKI was a strong predictor of 30-day mortality with an increasing risk across AKI stages [adjusted hazard ratio (HR) 1.59 (95%CI 1.19-2.13) for stage 1; p < 0.005, 2.71(95%CI 1.82-4.05); p < 0.001for stage 2 and 2.99 (95%CI 2.17-4.11); p < 0.001for stage 3]. One third of AKI3 survivors (30.7%), had newly established renal impairment at 3 to 6 months.CONCLUSIONS: This large UK cohort demonstrated a high AKI incidence and was associated with increased mortality even at stage 1. Inpatient diuretic use was linked to a higher AKI risk. One third of survivors with AKI3 exhibited newly established renal impairment already at 3-6 months.",

Cucurbit chlorotic yellows virus (CCYV) (Crinivirus), a newly reported virus occurring on cucurbit plants and many other plant species, is transmitted specifically by Bemisia tabaci MEAM1 (B biotype) and MED (Q biotype) cryptic species in a semipersistent manner. This study evaluated the impacts of CCYV on B. tabaci to better understand the plant-virus-vector interactions. By using CCYV-B. tabaci MED-cucumber as the model, we investigated whether or how a semipersistent plant virus impacts the biology of its whitefly vector. CCYV mRNAs were detectable in nymphs from first to fourth instars and adults of B. tabaci with different titers. Nymph instar durations and adult longevity of female whiteflies greatly extended on CCYV-infected plants, but nymph instar durations and adult longevity of male whiteflies were not significantly influenced. In addition, the body length and oviposition increased in adults feeding on CCYV-infected plants, but the hatching rates of eggs and survival rates of different stages were not affected. Most interestingly, the sex ratio (male:female) significantly reduced to 0.5:1 in whitefly populations on CCYV-infected plants, while the ratio remained about 1:1 on healthy plants. These results indicated that CCYV can significantly impact the biological characteristics of its vector B. tabaci. It is speculated that CCYV and B. tabaci have established a typical mutualist relationship mediated by host plants.",

Among various techniques, irradiation is a method of choice as it induces lethal biochemical or molecular changes that cause a downstream cascade of abrupt physiological abnormalities at the cellular level. In this study, we evaluated the effect of 60Co-� radiation on various developmental stages of Zeugodacus cucurbitae Coquillett and subsequent carry-over effects on the progeny. For this purpose, we treated eggs with 30- and 50-Gy radiation doses of 60Co-�. We found that radiation significantly affected cellular antioxidants, insect morphology, and gene expression profiles. Our results indicate that in response to various doses of irradiation reactive oxygen species, catalase, peroxidase, and superoxide dismutase activities were increased along with a significant increase in the malondialdehyde (MDA) content. We observed higher mortality rates during the pupal stage of the insects that hatched from irradiated eggs (50 Gy). Furthermore, the life span of the adults was reduced in response to 50 Gy radiation. The negative effects carried over to the next generation were marked by significantly lower fecundity in the F1 generation of the irradiation groups as compared to control. The radiation induced morphological abnormalities at the pupal, as well as the adult, stages. Furthermore, variations in the gene expression following irradiation are discussed. Taken together, our results signify the utility of 60Co-� radiation for fruit fly postharvest management.",
